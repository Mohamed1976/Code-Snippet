        <p>
            For the exam, you need to understand both conditional and iterative program flow. Conditional
            program flow enables an application to examine the state of an object or variable to
            decide which code path to process. The commands you use to apply the concept of conditional
            flow are the if…else statement, the switch statement, and the ternary operator.            
        </p>
        <p>
            To use a conditional flow statement, you must evaluate some data against some condition,
            which you do by using conditional operators. You can use logical operators to combine
            conditional operators. Combining operators is useful when more than one condition must
            be met—or at least one condition from a set of conditions must be met—before processing
            specific logic. The list below outlines the available operators.            
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>&gt; </em>Evaluates whether the value on the left is greater than the value on the right</li>
            <li><em>&lt; </em>Evaluates whether the value on the right is greater than the value on the left</li>
            <li><em>&gt;= &lt;= </em>Evaluates the same as &gt; or &lt; but with the additional logic that the values can also be equal</li>
            <li><em>!= !== </em>Evaluates whether the values aren’t equal</li>
            <li><em>== </em>Evaluates whether the values are equal independent of the underlying data type</li>
            <li><em>=== </em>Evaluates whether the values are equal both in value and underlying data type</li>
            <li><em>&& </em>The AND logical operator, in which the expressions on both sides must evaluate to true</li>
            <li><em>|| </em>The OR logical operator, in which at least one expression on either side must evaluate to true</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Two conditional operators are available for checking equality: == (equality operator) and ===
            (identity operator). Checking for equality with the == operator will ignore the underlying
            data type, whereas the === identity operator will consider data type. Look at the following
            example:<br><br>
            var n = 2000, s = '2000';<br>
            alert(n == s);<br>
            alert(n === s);<br><br>
            The first expression, which uses the equality operator, evaluates to true because the string
            is cast to a number for the purpose of the evaluation. The second expression, which uses
            the identity operator, evaluates to false because the string ‘2000’ isn’t equal to the integer
            2000.            
        </p>
        <p>
            When using the logical OR operator in an if statement, the JavaScript engine knows that it can
            proceed if any of the statements are true. As such, it evaluates the expressions from left to
            right until it finds one that’s true. As soon as it does, it won’t evaluate any further expressions
            but will immediately jump into the true code block.            
        </p>
        <p>    
            Sizing arrays is very dynamic, even though the array is initially
            declared to have a length of 5, if you try to access the 10th element, the array automatically
            resizes to accommodate the requested length. The following example demonstrates this
            concept:<br><br>
            var anArray = new Array(5);<br>
            alert(anArray.length);<br>
            anArray[9] = ‘soccer’;<br>
            alert(anArray.length);<br>
            Some array methods affect the Array object directly, whereas other methods return a new
            Array object. For the exam, you must understand when each case is applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>USING PUSH AND POP ON ANY ARRAY</strong><br>
            You can use the pop and push methods in any context to add and remove items from the
            end of an array. The stack concept is useful but isn’t a confining mechanism that limits use
            of these methods to just stack arrays.
