            Declarative event handling
            Handling events declaratively in the HTML markup is possible by setting up an event handlers
            line within the HTML elements. This is effectively no different than assigning a value to any
            other property or attribute of the HTML element.

            In this HTML markup, the onload attribute of the body element is assigned JavaScript to
            run. The onload event fires when the document itself is fully loaded into the browser. When
            the document is loaded, the onload event fires, which calls the onloadHandler function and in
            turn shows the alert box. Any events that will be looked at through this objective can be set
            up this way directly in the HTML markup.
        -->        
        <script>

            function onBodyLoadHandler() {
                console.log("onBodyLoadHandler executed.");
            }

            /*Assignment event handling
            Assigning the event function to the event property through JavaScript is another way to set
            up event handlers. This method has been around for a long time and is still widely used. For
            the preceding example of the onload event, the following changes are required to reflect
            assigning an event handler through JavaScript:
            In this code, the HTML element for the body is cleaned up and the onload event is assigned
            in JavaScript. The window object isn’t the same as the body element, but it demonstrates
            the concept of assigning code that needs to run as soon as the page is loaded. Notice
            that the assignment of the onloadHandler is in the script block but not inside any function.
            For this to succeed, the window object must exist. Since the window object is a global object
            it will exist. However, to access elements of the page, the page must be loaded or the script
            must run after the renderer processes the HTML. For example, if the page has a canvas and
            the functionality to enable users to draw on it with a mouse, the event handlers for the mouse
            activities would have to be assigned either at the bottom of the page or within the window’s
            onload event. The onload event is triggered when the entire page is loaded, so it’s possible to
            get a reference to the page elements and hook up the event handlers. */
            window.onload = onloadHandler();
            function onloadHandler() {
                console.log("onloadHandler executed.");
            }

            /*A more common way to do this is to assign an anonymous function to the window’s
            onload event and hook up all the necessary events. The concept of an anonymous function is
            discussed shortly. It’s used throughout the book as shown here:  The onload
            event for the window object is being assigned an anonymous function. This function doesn’t
            have a name and can’t be called by any other code. The inner implementation of the window
            object runs this function when raising the onload event.
            Note: JavaScript event window.onload not triggered, remove the event handlers above to trigger event handler.

            The browser provides dynamic behavior through events. Actions processed by the browser
            user can trigger an opportunity for your code to react and create an experience for the user.
            This opportunity is presented in the form of an event. The DOM elements natively provide
            events that can be handled, and you can implement custom events on custom objects.
            Events typically follow a naming convention. When looking at what events are available on
            a particular object, you can identify those events as properties that start with the prefix on.
            For example, some common events are onkeypress or onblur. For events to function, you need
            to “wire them up” by assigning an event handler. The event handler is a JavaScript function
            that’s called when an action triggers the event. Events are firing all the time in the browser;
            however, it is whether or not a handler is assigned that determines whether or not you can
            run your own code when the event is triggered.            
        </p>
        <p>
            The reason an API provides events is so that developers can inject their own processing amid
            all the action taking place in a program. JavaScript enables you to do exactly this throughout
            the DOM. This section discusses the ability to hook up to these events.
            The idea of hooking up an event is to tell the browser that when a certain event occurs,
            it should call a specified function. The function assigned to an event is said to be an event
            listener listening for that event. The need, then, is to assign a function to an event to listen for
            when that event occurs.            
        </p>

        <span>You can hook up an event in three ways:</span>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Declare it directly in the HTML markup.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Assign the function to the event property of the element object through JavaScript.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Use the newer add and remove methods on the element object to associate event handlers.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <span>When assigning event handlers through JavaScript, you have two choices: provide a
            named function or assign an anonymous function.</span>
        
        <h3>Event objects</h3>    
        <p>
            A single object common to all DOM event handlers, and that’s the event object itself.
            In general, the event object is a common object available within event handlers that provides
            metadata about the event. For example, if keyboard events are being handled, you might
            want to know which key was pressed. If mouse events are being handled, you might want to
            know which mouse button was pressed. The event object contains all these properties.
        </p>
        <h3>Using the addEventListener and removeEventListener methods</h3>    
        <p>
        addEventListener and removeEventListener are the two preferred methods to hook up a function
        to an event and then to remove it later as needed. The addEventListener method accepts
        two required parameters and one optional parameter:<br><br>
        <code>window.addEventListener(&lt;event name&gt;,&ltevent function&gt;,&ltoptional cascade rule&gt;);</code><br>
        <code>window.removeEventListener(&lt;event name&gt;,&ltevent function&gt;,&ltoptional cascade rule&gt;);</code><br><br>
        The event name is the name of the event to be handled. The event name will be as you’ve
        seen in the previous examples except without the on prefix. For example, the name of the
        onload event is just load. The event function is the one that should run when the event occurs,
        the listener. The optional cascade rule provides some flexibility in how the events move through
        nested DOM elements. This is examined in more detail later in the discussion on event bubbling.
        The removeEventListener takes exactly the same parameters. What this implies is that more
        than one event listener can be added for the same event and then removed. Thinking in the
        context of a complicated program such as a game, you might need to turn on and off specific
        event handlers for the same event.    
        </p>

    <br>
    <a id="aLink" href="https://www.nu.nl/" target="_blank">News link not followed due to event suppressed in js.</a>
    <div id="feedback"></div>    

    <h3>Declaring and handling bubbled events</h3>
    <p>
        Another aspect to consider is the order in which events run when you are working
with a nested DOM element. In this case, the concept that is dealt with is event bubbling.
        Event bubbling is the concept that applies when the HTML document has nested elements.
        Consider the following HTML example:
    </p> 
    
    <div id="mainContainer">
        <div id="outer">
            <div id="middle" >
                <div id="inner"></div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <ol id="eventOrder"> </ol>
        <button type="button" id="clearButton">Clear</button>
        <input type="checkbox" id="TunnelingOrBubbling" name="eventBehaviour">
        <label for="eventBehaviour">Click events cascade down.</label>
        <input type="checkbox" name="cancelBubble">
        <label for="cancelBubble">Cancel bubbling or cascading behavior for inner div.</label><br>
        <span style="font-size: 80%;"><strong>Figure</strong> Three nested &lt;div&gt; elements to display the effect of event bubbling</span>
    </div>


    <p>
        When a div box is clicked,
        the click event fires. The event listener code in the assigned handler outputs the name of the
        clicked div to an ordered list so that the order in which the events are clicked is identified.
        The last parameter of the addEventListener method accepts an optional Boolean parameter.
        This parameter allows you to specify the cascading or bubbling effect of the event—that is to
        say, in which order the event processing occurs. The click event for each div has an event listener
        assigned. In the preceding example, the three div elements are nested. A user who clicks the
        inside or middle div also clicks the parent div because the div elements share the same physical
        space on the screen. This concept is called event bubbling.
        The event has bubbled up to the top. If you prefer to have the events handled in the
        opposite order—that is, to have them cascade down—the last parameter specified by the
        addEventListener method is specified as true. The order of the event processing has 
        reversed to be cascading instead of bubbling.        
    </p>

    <p>
        The order of the event processing has reversed to be cascading instead of bubbling.
        The cascading or bubbling effect of the events is convenient when you want it. However, the
        design of the webpage could involve nested elements, but each element’s click event should
        run only if the element is directly clicked. In this case, you can use a property of the event object
        called cancelBubble. If this property is set to true, the event bubbling or cascading stops with
        the event listener that sets it. This stops only the bubbling or cascading behavior. The code to
        cancel the bubbling of the event is added to the inner div element’s event listener:        
    </p>
    <p>
    <span><h3>Handling DOM events</h3></span><br>
    The DOM provides a large number of built-in events. The most common events used on a
    more day-to-day basis are covered in this section. The DOM provides these events via the
    JavaScript API. Functions can be specified as event listeners, and custom behavior can be
    implemented onto webpages based on the event occurring. These events apply to most DOM
    elements.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Change events</strong><br>
        A change event occurs when the value associated with an element changes. This most
        commonly occurs in input elements such as text-based inputs and others such as the range
        element. An example of the change event in action is shown here:
        In this example, as the range slider control changes with the mouse dragging it from one
        side to the other, the div displays the value of the slider bar.        
    </p>
    <div>
        <input id="aRange" type="range" max="200" min="0" value="0"/>        
        <span style="margin-left: 10px;width: 20px;" id="rangeValue">0</span>
        <input style="margin-left: 10px;width: 100px;" id="aText" type="text"/>
        <!--div id="rangeValue"></div-->
        <div id="textValue"></div>
    </div>
    <p>
        <strong>Focus events</strong> 
        Focus events occur when an element receives or loses the focus. The Table below lists the available
        events related to focus.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>focus </strong>Raised when the element receives the focus</li>
            <li><strong>blur </strong>Raised when the element loses the focus</li>
            <li><strong>focusin </strong>Raised just before an element receives the focus</li>
            <li><strong>focusout </strong>Raised just before an element loses the focus</li>
        </ul>        
    </p>
    <p>
        The number of focus events provide very good flexibility in how the focus of any particular
        DOM element is handled with respect to the timing. The blur event is commonly used to validate
        form fields. You can use the focus() method to set the focus to any element that causes
        the focus event hierarchy to occur. The following code shows how to use the blur event:        
    </p>
    <div>
        <label style="font-weight: bold;" for="firstName">FirstName: </label>
        <input id="firstNameText" type="text" name="firstName">    
        <div id="ruleViolation"></div>
    </div>

    <p>
        <strong>Keyboard events: </strong>
        Keyboard events occur when keys are pressed on the keyboard. The keyboard events in
        the Table below are available to be captured.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>keydown: </strong>Raised when a key is pushed down</li>
            <li><strong>keyup: </strong>Raised when a key is released</li>
            <li><del><strong>keypress: </strong>Raised when a key is completely pressed</del> 
                <span style="color: red;">Deprecated as can be read <a style="color: red;font-weight: bold;"

    <p>
        Code such as this can be used to filter out invalid characters from being entered into a text
        box. With keyboard events, extra properties are available on the event object to help out.
        For example, you might need to know whether the Shift key or Control key was also being
        pressed. The Table below lists the event object properties for keyboard events.        
    </p>

    <span><strong>Event object properties for keyboard events</strong></span>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>altKey</strong>A Boolean value to indicate whether the Alt key was pressed</li>
        <li><strong>keyCode</strong>The numeric code for the key that was pressed</li>
        <li><strong>ctrlKey</strong>A Boolean value as to whether the Control key was pressed</li>
        <li><strong>shiftKey</strong>A Boolean value as to whether the Shift key was pressed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can use properties such as ctrlKey with the keyCode event to give the users something
        similar to hotkey functionality to automatically navigate the focus to specific fields:</p>     
    
    <p>
        <h3>Mouse events</h3>
        The DOM provides extensive exposure to mouse activity through the mouse events. The Table below
        describes the available mouse events.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>click </strong>Raised when the mouse performs a click</li>
            <li><strong>dblclick </strong>Raised when the mouse performs a double-click</li>
            <li><strong>mousedown </strong>Raised when the mouse button is pressed down</li>
            <li><strong>mouseup </strong>Raised when the mouse button is released</li>
            <li><strong>mouseenter or mouseover </strong>Raised when the mouse cursor enters the space of an HTML element</li>
            <li><strong>mouseleave </strong>Raised when the mouse cursor leaves the space of an HTML element</li>
            <li><strong>mousemove </strong>Raised when the mouse cursor moves over an HTML element</li>
        </ul>
        <span>The mouse events provide additional information on the event object. The Table below lists the
            applicable properties of the event object.</span>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>clientX </strong>The x or horizontal position of the mouse cursor relative to the viewport boundaries</li>
            <li><strong>clientY </strong>The y or vertical position of the mouse cursor relative to the viewport boundaries</li>
            <li><strong>offsetX </strong>The x or horizontal position of the mouse cursor relative to the target element</li>
            <li><strong>offsetY </strong>The y or vertical position of the mouse cursor relative to the target element</li>
            <li><strong>screenX </strong>The x or horizontal position of the mouse cursor relative to the upper-left corner 
                of the screen</li>
            <li><strong>screenY </strong>The y or vertical position of the mouse cursor relative to the upper-left corner of the screen</li>

        <h3>Creating custom events</h3>
        DOM events provide a great deal of functionality. In some cases, you might want to create
        a custom event to use more generically. To create a custom event, you use the CustomEvent
        object. To use custom events, you first need to create one by using the window.CustomEvent.
        object.

        <h2>Drag-and-drop functionality</h2>
        Drag-and-drop functionality enables users to pick up an element with the mouse and place it
        in another location. The Table below lists the events related to drag-and-drop functionality.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>drag </strong>Raised continuously while the element is being dragged</li>
            <li><strong>dragend </strong>Raised on the element being dragged when the mouse is released to end 
                the drop operation</li>
            <li><strong>dragenter </strong>Raised on a target element when a dragged element is dragged into its space</li>
            <li><strong>dragleave </strong>Raised on a target element when a dragged element leaves its space</li>
            <li><strong>dragover </strong>Raised continuously on the target element while the dragged element is being
                dragged over it</li>
            <li><strong>dragstart </strong>Raised on the element being dragged when the drag operation is beginning</li>
            <li><strong>drop </strong>Raised on the target element when the dragged element is released</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        A lot happens in a drag-and-drop operation, starting with the dragstart event. The drag
        event continues to fire while the element is being dragged. As the element is dragged over
        other elements, each of those other elements’ dragenter, dragover, and dragleave events fire.
        When the element finishes being dragged, its dragend event fires and the drop event of a
        target element fires. You can use all these events in combination to provide visual feedback to
        users that the drag operation is occurring and what might be a potentially valid drop location.        
    </p>
