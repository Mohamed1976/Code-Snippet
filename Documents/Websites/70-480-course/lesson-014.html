            This objective examines the user interface elements made available by HTML5 that allow
            users to provide input. The ability to capture information from users is a great feature. However,
            you must ensure that user privacy and safety are protected as best as possible. You also
            must ensure that the website doesn’t open any holes that an attacker can exploit to disrupt
            the site’s services. Part of protecting the site is choosing the correct user input controls for
            the job and setting the appropriate attributes on those controls to ensure that the data is
            validated. For the exam, you need to know these input controls and the attributes they use
            for this purpose.HTML5 provides a wide assortment of controls to make capturing user input simple and
            secure.            
        </p>
        <p>
            The &lt;input&gt; element in HTML denotes input controls. This element contains a type attribute
            that specifies the type of input element to render. The exceptions to the &lt;input type=’’&gt;
            rule are the &lt;textarea&gt; and &lt;button&gt; elements, which have their own element support.

        <h4>Using text and textarea input types</h4>  
        <p>                       
            The text and textarea input controls are the most flexible. By using these controls, you allow
            users to enter any text that they want into a regular text box. A text box provides a single-line
            text entry, whereas a textarea allows for a multiline data entry. 
            For the first and last names, the input is a standard text box as denoted
            by type=”text”. This tells the renderer to display an input field into which users can enter freeform
            text. However, this type of input field is limited to a single line. The Other Comments
            text box provides a multiline text area for users to enter text into. The rows and cols attributes
            define the viewable size of the text area. In this case, users can enter many lines of text into
            the text area.
            Other attributes that help with controlling how much information is entered into the text
            fields is the maxlength attribute:
            &lt;input type="text" id="firstNameText" maxlength="50"/&gt;    
            Users can’t enter any more than 50 characters into the text field with the maxlength set to
            a value of 50. In some cases, you might want to ensure that users enter only certain information in a
            certain format.
        </p>

        <h4>url input type</h4>
        <p>            
            The &lt;input&gt; type of url displays a text box similar to what the &lt;input&gt; type of text provides.
            However, the renderer is instructed that the input type is url, so when users try to submit
            a form with this type of information on it, it validates that the text in the box matches the
            format of a valid URL.Form 2 code demonstrates the power of the url input type in validating that the text a user
            entered is indeed a valid URL format. If a user typed something other than a URL or an incomplete
            URL into the Your Favorite Website box, such as contoso.com, and then clicked the
            Submit Query button, the form would show a validation error. If you require more flexibility and want to accept partially entered URL information, such
            as contoso.com, don’t use the url input box. A regular text input with a pattern specified would
            be more appropriate.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Using the password input control</h4>
        <p>
            The password input control is the standard method of prompting users for sensitive
            information. As you type your password, each character is replaced with a glyph so that any
            onlookers can’t see your password.
            The password text box doesn’t look any different than any other text box. However,
            typing into the box provides a different experience.The password input type captures information securely. Users typing this information don’t
            want others who are nearby to be able to see what they’ve been typing and hence compromise
            their data.
            <br><br><i>
                You can’t specify default text in a password box or write to it via JavaScript. This is a security
                safeguard to help ensure the safety of passwords. However, the browsers provide a
                mechanism to store a password should a user choose to have the password remembered
                by the browser.
            </i>            
        </p>
        
        <h4>Using the email input type</h4>
        <p>
            You can use the email input type to ensure that the format of the text entered into the text
            box matches that of a valid email address. Being able to capture an email address is often important
            to enable further follow up with a user. This control helps ensure that the information
            entered matches what’s expected in the form of an email address. Note validation of the email input type confirms only that the information entered matches the
            expected format of a valid email address. It in no way verifies that the email address itself
            is a valid mailbox that can receive messages. This validation helps ensure that you don’t mistype your email address. Of course, it
            doesn’t prevent you from entering an invalid email address, only one where the format
            doesn’t match correctly to what would be expected such as having the @ symbol and ending
            with a .com or other domain suffix.            
        </p>
        
        <h4>Using the checkbox input type</h4>
        <p>
            In some cases when capturing information from users, you need to be able to capture more
            than one choice as it relates to a specific question. In this case, the checkbox input control
            is the best choice. You can provide a series of check boxes and allow users to select all that
            apply.provides a way to default a check box to the “checked” (or selected) state. By default, check
            boxes aren’t selected. However, by adding the attribute as follows, the check box defaults to
            the “checked” state when the page is loaded:<br><br>
            &lt;input type="checkbox" id="chkBrown" checked="checked"/&gt; Brown<br>
            &lt;input type="checkbox" id="chkBrown" checked/&gt; Brown<br><br>
            In other cases, when presented with a list of items, users might be able to choose only a
            single item from the list.
        </p>

        <h4>Using the radio input type</h4>
        <p>
            The radio button is similar to the check box in that it provides a list of options for users to
            select from. The difference from the check box is that users can select only a single item from
            the list. An example would be asking users to rate something on a scale from 1 to 5.
            Notice that as with all HTML elements, each radio input type needs a unique id. However,
            the name attribute ties all the radio buttons together. With the same name specified for each
            radio type, the browser knows that they are part of a group and that only one radio button
            of the group can be selected.In this output, the radio buttons are shown from left to right and enable users to select
            only one option. When a user changes the selection to a different option, the previously
            selected option is automatically cleared. Notice that as with all HTML elements, each radio input type needs a unique id. However,
            the name attribute ties all the radio buttons together. With the same name specified for each
            radio type, the browser knows that they are part of a group and that only one radio button
            of the group can be selected. In Form 1 and 2, the radio buttons are shown from left to right and enable users to select
            only one option. When a user changes the selection to a different option, the previously
            selected option is automatically cleared.Like with the checkbox input types, defaulting the state of the radio input to selected is
            possible. This is done in exactly the same way, by specifying the checked attribute:<br><br>
            &lt;input type="radio" id="chkFive" name="experience" checked="checked"/&gt; 5 - Very Good<br><br>
            In this case, the rating of 5 - Very Good defaults to selected for the group of radio buttons.
            You can have multiple groups of radio buttons on the same page by specifying a different
            name for each group of buttons.        
        </p>

        <h4>Using the range input type</h4> 
        <p>
            Using the range input type enables users to specify a value within a predefined range by
            using a slider bar. This type can be used in cases where a wider range of values is required to
            choose from but using radio buttons would be too unwieldy.<br><br>    
        
            &lt;input type="range" min="1" max="25" value="20"/&gt;<br><br>

            This HTML markup provides users with a slider bar that they can use to specify a value
            between 1 and 25. The min attribute specifies the minimum value of the range; the max attribute
            specifies the maximum value. The value attribute specifies a default value. If you omit
            the value attribute, the range defaults to the minimum value.In this output, the range control is displayed as a slider bar. The bar defaults to the value of
            20 as specified in the markup. Users can grab the black endpoint of the slider and change the
            value lower or higher by dragging it left or right. As a user changes the value, a tooltip shows
            the current value where the slider resides.  
        </p>

        <h4>Using the button input type</h4>
        <p>            
            The input type that allows users to submit the form or clear it is button. The button input isn’t
            new to HTML5 but is an essential piece to the data-capture puzzle. Buttons are what tell the
            website when a user finishes doing something and that they want to perform an action. The
            &lt;input&gt; element supports three types of button controls: submit, reset, and button.
            The submit input type tells the HTML form to post its information to the server (or, in some
            cases, to another site or webpage). The reset type automatically clears all form elements to
            their default values. The button type provides a generic button with no predefined functionality.
            It can be used to provide a custom function, such as cancel out from this page and
            return to the home page. All three button types are added to the bottom of the survey page.
            That’s all that’s required to add the functionality to the page for each button. Of course,
            type=”button” requires some JavaScript to be wired up to actually do something. However,
            the submit and reset buttons come with the described functionality built in.
            The text on the buttons is the default text. The submit button comes with the text Submit
            Query, and the reset button comes with the text Reset. This can’t be changed. However, the
            button type doesn’t have any text on it because none was specified and the button doesn’t
            come with any predetermined behavior. To specify text for this button, add the value attribute.
            <br><br>
            &lt;input type="button" value="Cancel"/&gt;                        
            <br><br>
            That’s what you get with the input type of button. However, in some cases, more flexibility
            in the button’s content is desired. This is where the button element comes in handy.

            <br><br>
            <i>Note Anything can be a “button.” Because most DOM elements have a click event or at least
            a mousedown and mouseup event, the concept of clicking can be captured and custom
            actions processed. This can inherently turn any part of the DOM into a ”button.”</i>            
        </p>

        <h4>Using the button element</h4>
        <p>
            The button element provides a button on the user interface, just as the name implies.
            However, from a graphical perspective, this element behaves very differently.
            The button element also supports a type attribute, like as the ones seen previously: submit,
            reset, and button. This example steps away from the survey and demonstrates these buttons
            on a stand-alone page.This output displays three buttons, as expected. However, it doesn’t provide any text on
            the buttons. The button element provides only the desired click behavior, such as submitting,
            resetting, or providing a custom behavior like with type=”button”. Everything else must be
            specified in the HTML, including the label or text that goes on the button. In this way, you
            have much more control over what’s put on the button. Instead of Submit Query as with the
            &lt;input&gt; element, the text can be set as Submit Survey or Save Data.
            You can take the button element even further. The element’s contents don’t have to be just
            plain text. You can embed images within the element by using the &lt;img&gt; element in addition
            to text, or embed an entire clickable paragraph. You also can apply cascading style sheets
            (CSS) to the button to change its appearance.
            Within the button element lies the capability to create a highly customized button and get
            default behavior from the browser.
        </p>


        <h3>Implementing content attributes</h3>
        <p>
            In addition to what’s provided by the various input types, such as range, email, and url,
            other attributes are available and common across most of the input controls and provide additional
            flexibility in how the fields are validated. Input controls provide content attributes that allow you to control their behavior in the
            browser declaratively rather than have to write JavaScript code.
        </p>

        <h4>Making controls read-only</h4>
        <p>
            Part of the specification for the HTML input controls includes a readonly attribute. If you want
            to present information to users in elements such as text boxes but don’t want them to be able
            to alter this data, use the readonly attribute. When readonly is specified, the renderer won’t
            allow users to change any of the data in the text box. You can specify readonly as follows:<br><br>
            &lt;input type="text" readonly value="00XY998BB"/&gt;<br>
            &lt;input type="text" readonly="readonly" value="00XY998BB"/&gt;<br><br>
            In the Form below at the top of the survey form, users are provided a secret code to correspond
            with their survey. They can’t change this because the readonly attribute is specified.    
        </p> 

        <h4>Providing a spelling checker</h4>
        <p>
            Checking spelling is another method available to validate user input. The spellcheck attribute
            helps provide feedback to users that a word they’ve entered is misspelled. Again, this attribute
            is applied to the input element:<br><br>
            &lt;textarea id="otherCommentsText" rows="5" cols="20" spellcheck="true"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;<br><br>
            In this HTML, the spellcheck option has been turned on for the Other Comments text area
            because users can type whatever they want and might make spelling errors.
            The output of a text box with spellcheck isn’t any different until a user starts typing and
            enters a spelling error.In some cases, the built-in validation provided by the input controls isn’t sufficient, and
            providing a custom pattern to validate is better
        </p>

        <h4>Specifying a pattern</h4> 
        <p> 
            As you saw with the email and url input types, built-in validation is fairly thorough in ensuring
            that the information entered is accurate and as expected. However, in some cases you might
            require looser or stricter validation. Suppose that you don’t want users to have to specify
            the HTTP protocol in a url type, but you want to allow only .com or .ca websites. This can be
            achieved by using the pattern attribute, which allows the use of a regular expression to define
            the pattern that should be accepted.
            The following code shows the pattern attribute used to achieve the desired validation:<br><br>
            &lt;input type="text" title="Only .com and .ca are permitted."
            pattern="^[a-zA-Z0-9\-\.]+\.(com|ca)$"/&gt;<br><br>
            Plenty of regular expressions are available to validate a URL; this one is fairly simple. When
            specifying the pattern attribute, you should specify the title attribute as well. The title attribute
            specifies the error message to users in the tooltip when validation fails.
            To ensure that users enter the data in the correct format, you should show them a sample
            of what the data should look like. This is achieved with the placeholder attribute.            
            <br><br>
            <i>Note The pattern attribute applies only to text boxes. It can’t be used to override the validation
            built into the email or url types.</i>            
        </p>

        <h4>Using the placeholder attribute</h4> 
        <p>
            The placeholder attribute enables you to prompt users with what’s expected in a certain
            text box. For example, an email text box might show placeholder text such as
            me@mydomain.com. More importantly, this placeholder text doesn’t interfere with users
            when they start typing their information into the text box. The placeholder attribute achieves this.            
            <br><br>
            &lt;input type="email" placeholder="me@mydomain.com" /&gt;
            <br><br>
            The placeholder text is slightly lighter in color. As soon as a user puts the mouse cursor
            into the box to type, the placeholder text disappears and the user’s typing takes over.
            HTML fields can be validated in many ways. In some cases, it’s not so much what is put into
            the field, but that the field is indeed filled in. The required attribute controls this for the HTML
            elements.            
        </p>
        
        <h4>Making controls required</h4>
        <p>
            To ensure that a user fills in a field, use the required attribute with the &lt;input&gt; element. Doing
            so ensures that users will be told that the field is required. In this example, the email address
            will be made a required text box:<br><br>
            &lt;input type="email" placeholder="me@mydomain.com" required/&gt;<br><br>
            With the required control specified, if users try to submit the form without specifying an
            email address, they get an error message. Now users can’t submit until they
            specify a valid email address. The capabilities of the input controls can provide quite a robust validation framework.
            However, more needs to be done to ensure that the website is safe and secure.
        </p>

        <i>
            You can validate data in many ways. Even more options become available in HTML5,
            such as the url input type. Also available are the pattern attribute and the use of regular
