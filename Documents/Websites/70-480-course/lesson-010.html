        Web workers present a way of developing multithreaded JavaScript applications. JavaScript is
        a single-threaded environment. Everything run in JavaScript is queued up synchronously. This
        might not be evident in most applications because the available processing power on client
        computers usually far exceeds what’s required by a webpage on a client computer. However,
        in more intense web applications, you have seen warning messages from the browser that the
        scripts are running and taking a long time to complete. In fact, these warnings give users the
        option to stop running scripts on the page immediately. This type of user experience won’t
        have users coming back to the website. This is where the Web Worker API is useful.        
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Creating a worker process with the Web Worker API</h3>
        The Web Worker API is based on the JavaScript messaging framework. This underlying
        structure enables your code to send parameters to a worker and have the worker send results
        back. A basic web worker is established by creating a separate file to contain the script that
        will be processed on the separate thread. The Worker object is available from the global
        namespace and is created like so:<br><br>
        <code>var webWorker = new Worker("workercode.js");</code><br><br>
        This instantiates a new worker process and specifies what file contains the code to be run
        on the worker thread. The Worker object supports the functionality described in the Table below.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>postMessage </strong> Starts the worker process. This method expects a single parameter containing the
                data to pass to the worker thread. If nothing is required in the worker thread, an
                empty string can be supplied.</li>
            <li><strong>terminate </strong>Stops the worker process from continuing.</li>
            <li><strong>onmessage </strong>Specifies the function for the worker thread to call back to when complete. This
                function accepts a single parameter in the form of EventData with a property named
                data containing the values.</li>
            <li><strong>onerror </strong><span>Specifies a function to call when an error occurs in the worker thread. The onerror
                method receives event data, including the following:
                message: textual message of the error
                filename: the filename the error occurred in
                lineno: the line number in the file that created the error</span></li>
        </ul>        
    </p>
    <p>
        As soon as the Worker object is instantiated, it’s available for use at any time. All that’s
        needed to start the process is to call the postMessage method:<br><br>
        <code>webWorker.postMessage("");</code><br><br>
        As soon as the webWorker is running, the main application continues as usual. If something
        occurs that the worker process should be canceled, a call to the terminate method would
        achieve this:<br><br>
        <code>webWorker.terminate();</code><br><br>
        After the worker process completes and results need to be processed, the onmessage
        function is called from the worker. This should be set up before starting the worker:<br><br>
        <code>webWorker.onmessage = function(evt) {…}</code><br><br>
        That’s everything required on the calling side or in the web application to create and
        manage a worker process. Next, you need to create the worker code itself. For this, you create
        the workercode.js file that was used in the constructor. The first line of the file will be the
        onmessage property being assigned a function to process:<br><br>
        <code>onmessage = function(e){…}</code><br><br>
        This tells the runtime the entry point to the work to be run within the worker process.
        Somewhere in the worker process, where a result should be sent back to the calling application,
        the postMessage method is called:<br><br>
        <code>onmessage = function(e) {<br>
        …<br>
        self.postMessage(result);<br>
        }</code><br><br>
        That’s what’s involved in creating a worker process. In the last piece, notice the user of the
        <strong>self</strong> keyword. The self keyword is similar to the this keyword. The worker process runs in its
        own context, meaning that it has its own global namespace. The <strong>self</strong> keyword gives access to
        the global namespace within the worker process.                
    </p>

        <h3>Understanding web worker limitations</h3>
        Web workers are very convenient. They can solve many processing problems in intensive web
        applications. However, be aware of the limitations imposed on workers as well.<br><br>
        <strong>Passing parameters</strong><br>
        The postMessage method accepts a parameter that enables it to pass data to the worker that
        it might need to operate on or with. The postMessage parameter is a string—it can take any
        serializable object such as native data types, JSON objects, or XML. The parameter can’t be a
        function.        
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Number of workers</strong><br>
        Although no limit is imposed on how many workers can be processed or created concurrently,
        the number of workers used is something that you need to be pay attention to. Creating
        workers is a heavy operation. Each worker creates threads at the operating system level and
        their use should be managed accordingly. If you want a high volume of workers, consider
        creating a pool that can be used in a round-robin fashion so that not too many workers are
        created.        
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>DOM access</strong><br>
        Workers operate in their own global context, which means that they don’t have access to the
        DOM of the page that invoked them. The DOM shouldn’t be manipulated from a worker process.
        The worker context has no access to the window object, document object, or any parent
        object.        
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Subworkers</strong><br>
        Following the same patterns as for a worker from the main webpage, a worker can create
        workers as well. All constructs must be followed for passing data and getting data returned.
        However, knowing how many total workers will be created becomes increasingly important.        
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Configuring timeouts and intervals</strong><br>
        You can set up a web worker to run on a specified interval in the background. This is done by
        using any existing setTimeout or setInterval methods. The setTimeout method calls a specified
        function after the specified delay. The setInterval calls the specified function repeatedly after
        each specified time interval. For example, the following code runs the worker after 3 seconds:<br><br>
        
        <code> 
        var work = new Worker("workerFile.js");<br>
        setTimeout(function(){<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;work.postMessage("");<br>
        },3000);
        </code><br><br>

        However, the following code runs the worker every 3 seconds:<br><br>
        <code>var work = new Worker("workerFile.js");<br>
        setInterval(function() {<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;work.postMessage("");<br>
        },3000);
        </code>        
    </p><br>
