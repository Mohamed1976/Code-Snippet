    <h1>HTML5 document structure</h1>
    <p>
        A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
        Examples of non-semantic elements: &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; - Tells nothing about its content.
        Examples of semantic elements: &lt;form&gt;, &lt;table&gt;, and &lt;article&gt; - Clearly defines its content.
        Many web sites contain HTML code like: &lt;div id="nav"&gt; &lt;div class="header"&gt; &lt;div id="footer"&gt; to indicate navigation, header, and footer.        
        In HTML there are some semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page:  
        <ul>
            <li>article</li>
            <li>aside</li>
            <li>details</li>
            <li>figcaption</li>
            <li>figure</li>
            <li>footer</li>
            <li>header</li>
            <li>main</li>
            <li>mark</li>
            <li>nav</li>
            <li>section</li>
            <li>summary</li>
            <li>time</li>                        
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            HTML5 introduced new semantic elements to more clearly define sections of an HTML
            page. These elements include &lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;,
            &lt;progress&gt;, &lt;mark&gt;, &lt;figure&gt;, and &lt;figcaption&gt;.            
        </li>
        <li>
            Elements within an HTML page can have their layout controlled when they are included
            inside structures such as &lt;div&gt; elements and/or HTML tables.        
        </li>
        <li>
            HTML5 semantic elements provide the mechanisms necessary to structure the page
            more easily for accessibility via screen readers.
        </li>
        <li>
            Search engines take advantage of HTML5 semantics by leveraging the &lt;article&gt;
                element to determine the purpose of the page.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <strong>HTML5 semantic markup</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>&lt;article&gt; </strong>Defines self-contained areas on a page</li>
        <li><strong>&lt;aside&gt; </strong>Defines smaller content areas outside the flow of a webpage</li>
        <li><strong>&lt;figcaption&gt; </strong>Defines the caption of a figure element</li>
        <li><strong>&lt;figure&gt; </strong>Defines content that contains a figure, such as an image, chart, or picture</li>
        <li><strong>&lt;footer&gt; </strong>Defines the bottom of a section or page</li>
        <li><strong>&lt;header&gt;</strong>Defines the top of a section or page</li>
        <li><strong><del>&lt;hgroup&gt; </del> </strong>Defines a group of headings (H1–H6 elements)</li>
        <li><strong>&lt;mark&gt; </strong>Defines text that should be highlighted</li>
        <li><strong>&lt;nav&gt; </strong>Defines navigation to other pages in the site</li>
        <li><strong>&lt;progress&gt; </strong>Defines the progress of the task</li>
        <li><strong>&lt;section&gt; </strong>Defines the distinct content of a document</li>        
    </ul>
    <p>Note: The <strong>&lt;hgroup&gt;</strong> element has been removed from the HTML5 (W3C) specification, but it still is in the WHATWG version of HTML.

    <p><strong>Using the &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; elements</strong><br> 
        Most webpage documents contain common content at the top and bottom of all pages.
        Although using the &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; elements doesn’t automatically provide this functionality,
        the elements do provide the ability to define the content in the header and footer of
        the website.
        Typically, a webpage header contains content such as a company logo or banner. In some
        cases, it might also contain a navigation menu. (See the upcoming “Using the &lt;nav&gt; element”
        section for this.) Start the example page by adding the &lt;header&gt; element to your page:
    </p>

    <p>
        Using the &lt;nav&gt; element in an HTML5 document provides users with navigation through the
        main elements of the web document or web application as a whole. These main navigation
        elements could be represented as a list of links across the top of the page to navigate the
        current website. It could also list your favorite websites along the side of the page, such as in a
        blog where you list other favorite blogs that you follow.
        Typically, the list of links across the top, commonly known as the main menu of the web
        application, is contained in the header (but doesn’t have to be). A list of favorite URLs would
        most likely be placed into an &lt;aside&gt; so that the list could be placed off to the side, away
        from the main content but readily accessible.        
    </p>

    <p>
        The &lt;hgroup&gt; element is a semantic method that organizes headers and subheaders. This
        element typically contains the standard and familiar &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; elements. The &lt;hgroup&gt;
        element groups related headers in sequence. You can add a new &lt;hgroup&gt; element to your
        webpage to serve this purpose        
    </p>

    <p>
        An &lt;article&gt; element represents a whole and complete composition or entry. Examples of
        an &lt;article&gt; element could be a magazine article or a blog post, where the content can be
        redistributed independently and not lose its meaning. Each article is wholly contained within
        itself. You can have an article with subarticles; however, each subarticle must be a direct
        extension and related to the root article.        
    </p>
    <p>
        Each article added to the document in
        this example represents an independent part of the document that can be wholly contained.
        Typically, the first element within the &lt;article&gt; element is a header element or header group.
        Closely related to the &lt;article&gt; element is the &lt;section&gt; element, which you explore next.        
    </p>

    <p>
        The &lt;section&gt; element subdivides pages into sections. You could continue to break down
        the sample page with additional &lt;article&gt; elements; however, the purpose of the &lt;article&gt;
        element isn’t to break down a page into more granular details. This is where the &lt;section&gt;
        element becomes useful. Each &lt;article&gt; element contains zero or more &lt;section&gt; elements to
        denote the different content sections within the &lt;article&gt; element. Like an &lt;article&gt; element,
        the first element within a &lt;section&gt; element is typically a header or a header group.        
    </p>

    <p><strong>Note &lt;H1&gt; can be rendered differently depending on the context.</strong>
        When you view this page in the browser now, you might notice something quite interesting.
        The &lt;h1&gt; elements inside the &lt;hgroup&gt; elements are rendering differently from the previous
        &lt;h1&gt; elements in the same article. Considering that you haven’t applied any styles to this
        page yet, you might expect that all &lt;h1&gt; elements would render in the same style (for example,
        the same font size) as the &lt;h1&gt; element in the &lt;article&gt; element. However, when you
        render the page in the browser, you can see that this isn’t the case. This is because of the way
        the document parser in the browser works through the document to determine the implied
        hierarchy of the headings, also called the document outline.        
    </p>

    <p>
        The &lt;aside&gt; element defines any content that doesn’t fall within the main flow or main
        content of the current page—for example, a sidebar, a note, an alert, or an advertisement.
        The &lt;aside&gt; element doesn’t place itself automatically to any particular side of the webpage;
        it merely serves as a way to semantically define a section of text or graphics as an aside.
        The &lt;aside&gt; element isn’t treated as special in any
        way compared to the other elements used to structure your page. However, a little later you
        can see how much more easily you can style the content by using semantic markup, such as
        the &lt;aside&gt; element.                
    </p>

    <p>
        The &lt;figcaption&gt; and &lt;figure&gt; elements, new in HTML5, provide the semantic elements necessary
        for adding graphics and figures to webpages. These graphics and figures typically provide
        a visual representation of information in the textual content and referenced by the text. You
        often see such images in tutorials or textbooks in which the author directs the reader to a
        specific figure.        
    </p>  

    <p>
        The &lt;progress&gt; element represents the progress of an objective or task. The two supported
        types of progress tasks are determinate and indeterminate.
        Use a determinate progress task when you know in advance the amount of work to be
        completed; in other words, you know the starting and ending values. Sample scenarios for
        this case include downloading a file for which you know the exact size or displaying the
        progress of a fundraising effort. In both situations, you know the exact status of the task at
        any particular time, and you also know what the end goal is—either the number of bytes for
        the file download or the number of dollars for the fundraiser.        
    </p>
    <div>
        <p>ProgressBar simulation using js:</p>
        <span>0</span>
        <progress id="progressBar" value="0" max="1000"></progress>
        <span id="progressBarValue">0</span><br>
        <input type="button" id="startBtn" value="Start">
        <input type="button" id="ResetBtn" value="Reset">                
    </div>
    <p>
        As shown in the preceding code, the &lt;progress&gt; element has two attributes you need to
        know: value and max. The value attribute lets you specify the current value or position of the
        &lt;progress&gt; element at a specific point in time. The max attribute tells the browser what the
        maximum possible value is for the element. The browser uses these two values to determine
        how much of the element should be colored in. Usually, the value attribute updates dynamically
        using JavaScript. In Figure above, you can see how the &lt;progress&gt; element’s display
        changes when the value attribute is updated to 750.        
    </p>
    <p>
        You use indeterminate tasks when you don’t know how long a task will take to complete
        but still want to show users that some work is occurring and that they should wait. You still
        use the &lt;progress&gt; element but remove the value attribute. When you don’t specify the value
        attribute, the browser can infer that the &lt;progress&gt; element represents an indeterminate
        task. This might be useful for data received from a service where you have no control over or
        knowledge of how quickly the request will complete or how large the request results will be.
        The following HTML5 markup demonstrates an indeterminate task:        
    </p>
    <p>Data download is in progress, please wait patiently:</p>
    <progress max="5"></progress>

    <p>
        With the &lt;mark&gt; element, you can easily highlight important information or any text you
        want to emphasize. It has essentially the same function as a highlighter. By wrapping text in a
        &lt;mark&gt; element and providing a background-color attribute to its style element, you can get
        the desired highlight effect. The following HTML code demonstrates the &lt;mark&gt; element:        
    </p>

    <p>Some very <mark style="background-color:red;">important</mark> information provided here!</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Using the &lt;div&gt; element</strong><br>
        The new HTML5 semantic elements don’t (with the exception of the &lt;progress&gt; element)
        necessarily provide any default or altered behavior. Instead, they provide a stronger semantic
        definition to your webpages. This, in turn, gives you a more reliable and maintainable way to
        structure your pages and style them consistently. The goal of these elements is to replace the
        older method of structuring pages—prior to HTML5—by using &lt;div&gt; elements and naming
        them according to their function. However, note that the &lt;div&gt; element is still part of HTML5
        and still plays an important role. Use the new semantic elements as appropriate, but remember
        that the &lt;div&gt; element is still quite useful for styling content.
        This section explored the new semantic elements in HTML5. In the next section, you learn
        how to create and work with layout containers.        
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Creating a layout container in HTML</strong><br>
        You can lay out a webpage in various ways. An important aim here is to urge you to give
        serious thought to layout so that your page presentation is user friendly. If users can’t find
        what they are looking for because the entire page is styled as a single &lt;p&gt; element inside the
        &lt;body&gt; element, they aren’t likely to keep coming back. In this section, you look at a couple
        of layout options available in HTML. Chapter 4, “Use CSS in applications,” explains how to use
        cascading style sheets (CSS) to implement your layouts.
        The two most common methods of creating a layout in HTML involve using &lt;div&gt; and
        &lt;table&gt; elements. In either case, more than likely you will still use CSS to help with positioning
        and sizing. Still the catchall container elements, the familiar &lt;div&gt;s are often used to divide the page
        into various sections to create the layout. The rendering engine displays each &lt;div&gt; according to its rules. To position the divisions
        dynamically would require CSS.
        The main issue with using &lt;div&gt; elements to structure the document is their inability to
        impart standard semantic meaning to each section.
    </p>

    <div id="PageHeader" style="background-color:lightyellow;">div 1</div>
    <div id="LeftSide" style="background-color:lime;">div 2</div>
    <div id="RightSide" style="background-color:mediumorchid;">div 3</div>
    <div id="Footer" style="background-color:moccasin">div 4</div>

    <p>
        The &lt;div&gt; element allows for more dynamic capability in page layout. For a more static layout
        declared right in the HTML page, the &lt;table&gt; element is more appropriate. The following
        HTML defines a table that provides a common blog-site format, with a header section, a left
        sidebar, a content area, a right sidebar, and a footer area:        
    </p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="3" id="Header">First row</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan="3" id="LeftBar">First</td>
            <td rowspan="3" id="MainContent">Second</td>
            <td id="RightSideTop">Third</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td id="RightSideMiddle">Row</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td id="RightSideBottom">Row</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="3" id="Footer">Row</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        The &lt;table&gt; element is very flexible. Additional elements such as &lt;thead&gt; and &lt;tfoot&gt;
        provide a more semantic approach to labeling the table cells. The concern with using the
        &lt;table&gt; element approach is the static nature of the structure. To change the overall structure
        of a site that uses tables for layout, you need to go to every page and make the changes. It’s
        worth noting that some methods that make such changes easier have evolved over the years
        in response to the maintenance headache involved.        
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Optimizing for search engines</strong><br>
        When a website is required to create an online presence, you have to ensure that it can be
        found among the millions of sites that already exist. Search engine optimization (SEO) is
        a technique used to make elements of the website easily discoverable and appropriately
        indexed by search engines, so that when users search for content related to your site, they
        find your pages. Search engines such as Bing and Google constantly scour the Internet for
        content. When they find webpages, they go through the HTML and index content such as
        page and image metadata. They use the indexed data to allow users to search for essentially
        anything on the Internet and receive relevant results. Clearly, then, a relationship exists
        between the content on your websites and how easily users can find your sites using a search
        engine. With the semantic HTML elements discussed in the previous objective in mind, you
        should note some additional things with respect to the logic search engines use to discover
        what’s on websites. On the whole, the subject of SEO is far outside the scope of this book and
        exam; entire books are written on the subject. However, discussing how HTML5 impacts SEO
        and website design is relevant.        
        In the past (defined as pre-HTML5), web designers often used &lt;div&gt; elements to segment
        the page. These elements don’t provide very much context as to what they are intended to
        contain. But with the semantic markup available in HTML5, you can use more descriptive elements
        for the page sections. As you saw in the blog-page layout example, the HTML elements
        alone make clear the intent of each segment of the page. As search engines scour webpages,
        they detect the markup and know what to take from it to properly index the page.
        The &lt;article&gt; and &lt;section&gt; elements are the main ones used by the SEO algorithm. These
        elements are known to contain the main body of the page. That a page have more than one
        &lt;article&gt; and/or &lt;section&gt; element is acceptable; they all get indexed. Within each &lt;article&gt;
        element, the engine then seeks out elements such as &lt;hgroup&gt; or &lt;h1&gt; to get the main
        topic of the &lt;article&gt; element for relevant indexing. However, this doesn’t mean that if a site
        doesn’t have &lt;article&gt; or &lt;section&gt; elements, it won’t get indexed and be searchable. This
        speaks only to the quality of indexing the search engines can conduct to make your site more
        searchable by end users.
        SEO is a great technique to understand when designing websites. Creating a website just
        to leave it in the dark and hard to find doesn’t serve much purpose. Being found is very important
        and, when the site is found, you don’t want to limit your audience. Accessibility is also
        very important.

        <strong>Optimizing for screen readers</strong>
        Screen readers rely on the document outline to parse the structure and present information
        to the user. Screen-reader programs can read the text on the page and convert it to audio
        through a text-to-speech algorithm. This is helpful for users who might have difficulty viewing
        the webpage. As discussed earlier, the way the document gets outlined in HTML5 has
        changed. Here’s a little more detail.
        Prior to HTML5, a page was outlined using only the header elements (&lt;h1&gt; through &lt;h6&gt;).
        The relative position of each header element to the previous header element within the page
        created the hierarchy. Screen readers could use this information to present a table of contents
        to users. However, HTML5 introduced semantic elements to create new sections. This means
        that &lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, and &lt;aside&gt; elements all define new sections. The introduction
        of the semantic elements changes how the document outline is created. For example, if
        the following HTML was going to be the hierarchy of the sample document, you could possibly
        lay it out like this:
        <h1>Fruits and Vegetables</h1>
        <h2>Fruit</h2>
        <h3>Round Fruit</h3>
        <h3>Long Fruit</h3>
        <h2>Vegetables</h2>
        <h3>Green</h3>
        <h3>Colorful</h3> 
        
        The outline shows the default styles of the different header elements as expected. The
        heading elements create implied sections and subsections within the document. This is still
        valid in HTML5. However, you shouldn’t leave the page sectioning set to implied sectioning as
        presented by the header elements; rather, you should explicitly define the sections by using
        the appropriate semantics. Also recommended is that &lt;h1&gt; elements be used solely throughout
        an HTML5 document. To produce the same hierarchy in this fashion, you would need to
        change your HTML to be like the following:
        
        <section>
            <h1>Fruits and Vegetables</h1>

            <section>
                <h1>Fruit</h1>
                <section>
                    <h1>Round Fruit</h1>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h1>Long Fruit</h1>
                </section> 
            </section>
            
            <section>
                <h1>Vegetables</h1>
                <section>
                    <h1>Green</h1>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h1>Colorful</h1>
                </section>
            </section>
        </section>
        
        This HTML produces the same output as shown earlier. The difference is
        that now each &lt;section&gt; element creates a new page section rather than rely on the header
        elements to create the sections. Screen readers can parse the semantic elements to create the
        document outline and eventually can provide a much richer user experience because of how
        HTML5 allows webpage designers to lay out the pages.

    <h3>Important HTML5 notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Don’t use loads of &lt;h1&gt;s. Make &lt;h1&gt; the main heading of your page, then use &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, &lt;h4&gt;, etc. in a proper hierarchy without skipping levels.</li>
        <li>&lt;section&gt; can be used with aria-label to signal to a screen reader user where a particular sub-part of an article begins and ends. Otherwise, forget about it, or use another element, such as &lt;aside aria-label=”quick summary”&gt; or &lt;div role=”region” aria-label=”quick summary”&gt;.</li>
        <li>&lt;main&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt; and &lt;nav&gt; are very useful for screen reader users, and entirely transparent to those who don’t use assistive technology. So use them</li>
        <li>&lt;article&gt; isn’t just for blog posts — it’s for any self-contained thing. It also helps WatchOS display your content properly.</li>
        <li>Although the section element is technically styleable, it is suggested to use &lt;div&gt; instead when we are more likely to apply heavy styles or script to the element.</li>
        <li>Similar to &lt;li&gt; element, the general idea of section element is to list content.</li>
        <li>If the content within the element is not semantically related, then use a &lt;div&gt;. If the semantically related content is also able to be self-contained, then use an &lt;article&gt;. Otherwise, use a &lt;section&gt;.</li>
        <li>The &lt;article&gt; element specifies independent, self-contained content.</li>
        <li>The &lt;section&gt; element defines section in a document.</li>
        <li>In HTML pages we will see pages with &lt;section&gt; elements containing &lt;article&gt; elements, and &lt;article&gt; elements containing &lt;section&gt; elements.</li>
        <li>The &lt;header&gt; element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.</li>
        <li>A &lt;header&gt; element typically contains:
            <ul>
                <li>one or more heading elements (&lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt;)</li>
                <li>logo or icon</li>
                <li>authorship information</li>
                <li>    <strong>Note:</strong>  You can have several &lt;header&gt; elements in one HTML document. However, &lt;header&gt; cannot be placed within a &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;address&gt; or another &lt;header&gt; element.
                </li>
