            In 2007, Jeff Atwood made the quote that was popularly referred to as Atwood's Law: 
            <Strong>“Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.”</Strong>

            Node.js runtime is an alternative for server side code such as c#, it allows you to interact with database and files.  
            Node.js can be used for example to build webservices. 
            DOM (Document Object Model) is the functions and objects that JavaScript has access to in the webbrowser.

            In JavaScript there are three ways to declare variables:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>let </strong>Use it in loops</li>
                <li><strong>var </strong>Available in the entire scope, could lead to mistakes being made.</li>
                <li><strong>const </strong>Use it by default, clearly says this variable does not get  reassigned</li>
            </ul>
            Note: <strong>const</strong> and <strong>let </strong> can cover almost any usercase. 
        </div>
