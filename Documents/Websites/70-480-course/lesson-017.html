                <h1>JSON and XML data</h1>
                <p>
                    Data can be received and sent in many forms. In the preceding objective, JSON and XML were
                    examined specifically. The notion of presenting JSON or XML data directly to users isn’t ideal.
                    Users would appreciate receiving the data in a more usable or readable and meaningful way.
                    For this, you need to have the data converted from an XML string or JSON string into something
                    else. The concept of converting the data from one form to another is called serialization
                    or deserialization.
                    With serialization, the data is put into a format for transmission. With deserialization, the
                    transmitted data is converted into something that can be worked with, such as a custom
                    object. In addition to working with string data, applications can work with binary data. An
                    application might capture drawings or pictures on a canvas and send that data back to the
                    server. The data needs to be serialized into a binary stream to achieve this.
                    This objective reviews the serialization, deserialization, and transmission of binary
                    and text data. The ability to submit data via the HTML Form and sending data with the
                    XMLHttpRequest object is also reviewed.                    
                </p>

                <h1>Sending data by using XMLHttpRequest</h1>
                <p>
                    Sending data to the server is similar to receiving data. The code examples in the preceding
                    objective used the XMLHttpRequest object to receive data. The XMLHttpRequest object itself
                    is agnostic to sending or receiving. It can accomplish both tasks based on how the object is
                    set up. To send data, the send method must have data passed into it, and that data can be
                    transmitted to the endpoint specified in the URL of the open method. The following code
                    example sends the XML data to the server

                <h1>Serializing and deserializing JSON data</h1>
                <p>
                    The browser provides native support for working with JSON and XML. The JSON object
                    is available for converting a JSON string to and from an object (serialize/deserialize). The
                    following code shows how this is accomplished:<br><br>
                    <code>
                        var person = {<br>
                            &nbsp;FirstName: "Rick",<br>
                            &nbsp;HairColor: "Brown"<br>
                            };<br>
                            var jsonPerson = JSON.stringify(person);
                    </code><br><br>
                    The person object has been serialized into a JSON string that can be sent to an endpoint
                    URL for processing. To return the person back to a person object from a JSON string, the
                    object can be deserialized by using the parse method:<br><br>
                    <code>
                        var req = new XMLHttpRequest();<br>
                        req.open("GET", "MyJsonData.json", false);<br>
                        req.send(null);<br>
                        var jsonPerson = JSON.parse(req.responseText);
                    </code><br><br>
                    When this code runs, the person object is reconstructed from the JSON string.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h1>Serializing and deserializing binary data</h1>
                <p>
                    Capturing dynamic image data follows a similar pattern as with the other techniques
                    reviewed. The key difference is now the responsetype property must be set to blob. The
                    following code demonstrates retrieving a binary image object and deserializing it into the
                    webpage:<br><br>
                    <code>
                        var xReq = new XMLHttpRequest();<br>
                        xReq.open("GET", "orange.jpg", false);<br>
                        xReq.responseType = 'blob';<br>
                        xReq.send(null);<br>
                        var blob = xReq.response;<br>
                        document.getElementById("result").src = URL.createObjectURL(blob);                        
                    </code><br><br>
                    The XMLHttpRequest object’s responseType property has been set to blob. Then
                    by using the response property to extract the binary data, the BLOB is passed to the
                    URL.createObjectURL method. The createObjectURL method gives the img element a URL
                    linking to the BLOB, and the image is displayed in the browser. For the inverse, the data can
                    also be submitted to the server as soon as it’s serialized into a BLOB:<br><br>
                    <code> 
                        var xReq = new XMLHttpRequest();<br>
                        xReq.open("POST", "saveImage.aspx", false);<br>
                        xReq.responseType = 'blob';<br>
                        xReq.send(data);<br> 
                    </code>
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>
                    <h1>Using the Form.Submit method</h1> 
                    The form element of an HTML page is the area of the form that contains elements that are
                    typically input controls to gather information from users. The form element contains an action
                    attribute that tells the form where to submit its data. Submitting the data in this way submits the
                    entire HTML page back to the server for processing. However, another available mechanism is to
                    hook up to the form’s submit event and handle the submission through JavaScript. This is useful
                    for submitting the form’s data through an AJAX request so that users don’t have to leave the current
                    page while the request is being processed.The form in this case will post its data to the processSignUp server page for processing,
                    which in turn should redirect users back to a confirmation page of some sort. The other
                    option for handling the form’s submission is to wire up the event in JavaScript.
                    Iterating over all the form elements, capturing the data out of them, and constructing a
                    query string for use with an AJAX call would be possible inside the click event.
                    The data from each field in the form is extracted and concatenated into a query string
                    to submit to the server from the AJAX call. Although this method is functional, it has some
                    drawbacks. First, a form with many elements will cause this code to get long. As new elements
                    are added, the code will need to be updated. There is another option in the form of a jQuery
                    method called serialize().                    
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h1>Using the jQuery.serialize method</h1>
                <p>
                    jQuery provides a seamless way to encode data from an HTML form by traversing the form
                    that’s passed into it and looking for input boxes to construct and return a query string. Then
                    the query string can be posted to the server for processing.
                    In this case, the jQuery.serialize method handles the extraction of the data from all the
                    input elements and creates the query string. The advantage of using this method— beyond
                    saving a lot of code—is that the query string is also encoded.
                    The serialize method requires that all elements have the name attribute specified.
                    The serialize method acts on any results from the selector that’s passed into the $() segment
                    of the jQuery. However, the serialize method has some limitations that you should know
                    about. Only successful controls are serialized—meaning, only controls that are in a valid state.
                    For input controls such as check boxes and radio buttons, only the ones that are in a selected
                    state are considered. For radio buttons, because the name attribute must be the same for
                    them all to be considered in a radio button group, you would specify the value attribute to
                    differentiate them in the query string:<br><br>
                    <code>
                        &lt;input type="radio" name="gender" value="m"/&gt;<br>
                        &lt;input type="radio" name="gender" value="f"/&gt;<br>
                    </code><br><br>
                    The jQuery.serialize method makes the code involved to generate a query string of the
                    parameters from a form much simpler to create and less error prone.
