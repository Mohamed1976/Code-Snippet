       <h1>OO design in JavaScript</h1> 
        <p>
            JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language.
            Essentially, two types of objects exist in JavaScript:
            <ul>
                <li>Native JavaScript objects, which are provided with JavaScript itself</li>
                <li>Custom objects, which developers create to represent their own data constructs and
                    behaviors</li>
            </ul>
            Custom objects are created by the developer, whereas native objects are provided by core JavaScript.

            In some cases, creating an entirely new object isn’t necessary. You can base objects on
            other objects (if they are a subtype of that object) by using object inheritance, in which one
            object inherits all the attributes and behaviors of another object but can also implement
            additional aspects that are unique to it.
            Objects encapsulate functionality and state information that is relevant for them. The
            functionality is provided in the form of methods, whereas state information is provided in the
            form of properties.            
        </p>
        <p>
            Native objects are available to developers directly through JavaScript. JavaScript provides a
            large number of objects that provide functionality to make developers’ lives easier. Although
            covering every native object in JavaScript is out of scope for this book and this exam, you will
            be expected to be able to create and work with native JavaScript objects.
            Some native objects are available statically, which means you don’t need to create an
            instance of them. Others require you to create an instance. You can find both types among
            objects in the global namespace. One example of a static object is Math, which is available in
            the global namespace and provides a great deal of functionality without you having to create
            an instance:
