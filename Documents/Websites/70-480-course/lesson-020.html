                <p>
                    CSS files can become large and complex. Structuring them in an organized fashion will
                    make them easier to maintain and also to know what selectors are best suited to be used to
                    reference the HTML on your page.
                    CSS is used to apply styles to elements in an HTML page. To do so, the CSS has to know which
                    elements to apply the styles to. There are a few ways to reference elements from CSS. This
                    is known as the selector syntax. This has been demonstrated throughout the chapter. This
                    section will explain specifically how to reference elements from CSS. The key consideration is
                    to ensure that you reference elements such that the styles affect only the elements you want
                    affected. In large complex CSS, it can get complicated.
                    Elements can be referenced from CSS by their element name. For example:                    
                </p>
                <code>
                    p{…}<br>
                    article{…}<br>
                    div{…}                    
                </code>
                <p>
                    In this code, styles are applied to all paragraph elements, article elements, and div
                    elements.The next method to select elements is through the use of classes as shown here:                    
                </p>
                <code>
                    .bold{…}<br>
                    .largeTitle{…}
                </code>
                <p>
                    In this code, the styles are applied only to HTML elements that have their class attribute
                    assigned these class names. Element names and classes can be combined to narrow the
                    selector even further:                    
                </p>
                <code>
                    p.largeTitle{…}
                </code>
                <p>
                    This code applies the styles only to paragraph elements that have the class largeTitle
                    assigned to the class attribute.
                    The most granular method to reference HTML elements from CSS is by using the id or
                    name of the element:                    
                </p>
                <code>
                    #nameBox{…}
                </code>
                <p>
                    This code applies the specified styles only to the single element on the page with the
                    specified name.
                    In some cases, you might want to apply the same style to many elements of different
                    types. In this case, you can group them and define the styles only once:                    
                </p>
                <code>
                    p, H1, H2 {…}
                </code>
                <p>
                    In this sample, all three of the HTML elements noted will have the defined styles applied to them.

                <h2>Implementing inheritance</h2>
                <p>
                    Some styles applied to a parent element are automatically inherited by children elements.
                    For example, if a series of paragraph elements are inside an article element, and font and text
                    styles are applied to the article, all the paragraph elements will automatically inherit the font
                    and text styles as well. The following code demonstrates this concept:                    
                </p>
                <div class="style01">
                    hello div world.
                    <p>
                    Hello paragraph world.
                    </p>
                    <p class="style02">
                        Hello paragraph world, has it own style defined.
                    </p>    
                </div>
                <p>
                    Both the div and the paragraph will have the font and color styles applied to them because
                    the paragraph element does not have any of its own styles defined. If you assign styles to the
                    paragraph element to override the div styles you would be able to prevent the inheritance of
                    the styles.                    
                </p>

                <h2>Overriding inheritance using !important</h2>
                <p>
                    CSS for large websites can be complicated. Large websites may have CSS coming from different
                    sources. It could be on each page and referenced externally. External libraries are more
                    and more common as experts throughout the community have created themes that can be
                    imported into your web applications. With all this styling coming from different sources,
                    inheritance of styles can be tricky. In some cases you may just need to override all other 
                    competing styles completely with your own desired style. This is where the !important keyword
                    comes in. Consider the following simple CSS example:                    
                </p>
                <code>
                    p {<br>
                        &nbsp;font-family: serif;<br>
                        &nbsp;color: blue;<br>
                        }<br>
                        p {<br>
                            &nbsp;color: purple;<br>
                        }<br>
                        p{<br>
                            &nbsp;color: yellow;<br>
                        }                    
                </code>
                <p>
                    In this CSS code, you have three competing styles for the paragraph element. How the
                    browser renders this is based on the last style it reads for an element it applies to. So in
                    this case, the text in all the paragraphs will be yellow. However, if you want to override this
                    behavior and force the paragraph elements on the page to be purple, you simply add the
                    !important keyword to the style you want to have applied:                    
                </p>
                <code>
                    p {<br>
                        &nbsp;font-family: serif;<br>
                        &nbsp;color: blue;<br>
                        }<br>
                        p {<br>
                            &nbsp;color: purple !important;<br>
                        }<br>
                        p{<br>
                            &nbsp;color: yellow;<br>
                        }                    
                </code>
                <p>
                    The paragraph elements will render purple and not yellow. The !important notation tells
                    the parser to give that style priority. This is a simplistic example, but the concept is the same
                    whether the styles are in a single page such as this or if they come from a variety of external
                    sources with conflicting styles.
