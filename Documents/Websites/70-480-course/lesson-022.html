                The visibility property hides a control but keeps its position in the overall layout. Using
                the display property to hide a control removes it from the layout as well.

        <h1>Create an animated and adaptive UI</h1>
        <p>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            The modern day website is an interactive experience for the end user. CSS3 provides many
            mechanisms to apply a professional touch to the end-user interaction. This is achieved
            through the ability to animate and transform objects. By adding these rich features to
            your webpages, you really bring the experience to the next level. In addition, there is an
            opportunity to create a responsive user interface. A responsive user interface is one that can
            adapt itself automatically based on the size of the screen that is available. Finally, the ability to
            hide and disable controls provides you with the ability to further customize the user interface
            with CSS.        
        </p>                
        <section>
            <h2>Animating objects by applying CSS transitions</h2>
            Transitions provide a mechanism to alter the style of an object such that the change occurs
            in a visible gradual fashion. You have the ability to control which style property gets altered
            and how long it takes to complete its transition from one style to the other. A transition starts
            when the specified property is changed. In its simplest form, the following code transitions
            two properties of a div element: the margin-left and the background-color. The transition is to
            take one second. The transition will occur when the mouse is hovering over the div element.
            <div class="divStyle01"></div>
            <p>
                With this CSS code in place, when the user moves the mouse over the div element, it will
                move to the right and its background color will change to white. Since the background of
                the webpage is also white, it provides the effect of disappearing. You need to understand
                what properties are being used to achieve this effect. In this particular code, you are using
                a shorthand property called transition that allows you to specify a comma-separated list
                of CSS properties and a length of time for the transition of the specified property to take
                place. These properties could also be indicated separately using the various CSS properties in
                list below.                
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-style: italic;">transition-property </span>Specifies the property to which a transition will be applied</li>
                <li><span style="font-style: italic;">ransition-duration </span>Specifies how much time the transition should take from start to finish</li>
                <li><span style="font-style: italic;">transition-delay </span>Specifies how long to wait from the time the property is changed before starting
                    the transition</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Example below illustrates a transition example.</p>
            <code>
                div {<br>
                    &nbsp;width: 100px;<br>
                    &nbsp;height: 100px;<br>
                    &nbsp;background-color: gray;<br>
                    &nbsp;margin-left: 250px;<br>
                    &nbsp;margin-top:250px;<br>
                    &nbsp;transition: background-color 1s, margin-left 1s ;<br>
                    }<br>
                    div:hover {<br>
                        &nbsp;margin-left: 350px;<br>
                        &nbsp;background-color: white;<br>
                    }                
            </code>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                Note: When using the individual transition-* properties, you can specify only one property to
                transition. With the transition shorthand, you are able to specify a comma-separated list.                
            </p>

            <p>
                Another property that exists to control the speed of the transitions is transition-timingfunction.
                This property allows you to have a bit more control over the speed of the transition.
                With the transition-timing-function property, you can specify some different effects to the
                timing of the transition. The possible values are specified in list below.                
            </p>
            <strong>List: values for transition-timing-function.</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-style: italic;">ease </span>The default value that applies the effect in such a way that it starts slow, speeds up,
                    then ends slow.</li>
                <li><span style="font-style: italic;">linear </span>Makes the transition constant from start to finish</li>
                <li><span style="font-style: italic;">ease-in </span>Causes the transition to have a slow start.</li>
                <li><span style="font-style: italic;">ease-out </span>Causes the transition to have a slow finish.</li>
                <li><span style="font-style: italic;">ease-in-out </span>Causes the transition to have a slow start and a slow finish.</li>
                <li><span style="font-style: italic;">cubic-bezier </span>Allows you to define values. This takes four parameters that are values from 0 and 1.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Applying 3-D and 2-D transformations</h2>
            <p>
                Using CSS you are also able to apply transformations to elements on your webpage. In
                this section, you will review how to apply three dimensional transforms to your elements.
                Following with the same div from the previous section, you will apply the three-dimensional
                (3-D) transformations listed in Table 4-11. Two-dimensional (2-D) transforms are covered in
                Objective 1.3, “Apply transforms.”                
            </p>
            <strong>List: three-dimensional transformations</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-style: italic;">translate </span>Moves the object from its current location to a new location</li>
                <li><span style="font-style: italic;">scale </span>Changes the size of the object</li>
                <li><span style="font-style: italic;">rotate </span>Spins the object along the x-axis, y-axis, and/or the z-axis</li>
                <li><span style="font-style: italic;">matrix </span>Allows you to combine all the transformations into one command</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As you can see, the 3-D transforms are the same property values as the 2-D transforms.
                The addition is that each property now allows you to invoke the transform across the z-axis
                instead of just the x-axis and y-axis. In addition, there are shorthand properties available such
                as translate3d and rotate3d.
                To demonstrate the use of a 3-D transform, you will look at the rotate transformation. The
                following code applies a 3-D rotation of the div element.                
            </p>
            <code>
                div {<br>
                    &nbsp;transform: rotateX(30deg) rotateY(30deg) rotateZ(30deg);<br>
                    }                
            </code><br><br>
            <div class="transformation-style01">In a place far away.</div><br>
            <p style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">FIGURE 4-49</span> A div element being rotated in 3-D</p>
            <p>
                When the page loads, all div elements on the page will be rotated 30 degrees along each
                axis. The above transform could be expressed in this way as well:                 
            </p>
            <code>
                transform: rotate3d(1,1,1, 30deg);                
            </code>
            <p>
                In this case, rotate3d takes the first parameters to specify on which axis to rotate. A value
                of zero indicates to no rotation on that axis whereas a value of 1 indicates a rotation on that
                axis. The parameters are in order of x-axis, y-axis, z-axis. The last parameter specifies the
                number of degrees to rotate.
                You can experiment with each transformation. The output is similar to that of the 2-D with
                the exception that the effects are applied along the z-axis as well. In addition, you can see
                that you can still use the 3-D functions to achieve 2-D effects. It all depends which parameters
                you specify.                
            </p>

            <h2>Adjusting UI based on media queries</h2>
            <p>
                In the modern world, screen size is a variable you now have to contend with when building
                webpages. With many people accessing the Internet from different devices such as smart
                phones, tablets, and desktops, there is no guarantee that your page will fit nicely on the
                screen, and as a result, it may not be user friendly. This is where the concept of media queries
                is able to help. With the use of media queries you can create a responsive user interface that
                will adjust automatically as the size of the available rendered webpage changes. By using
                information from the browser, you are able to determine how to present your content so that
                it provides a user-friendly experience on any device.
                The media query syntax is as simple as adding the following to your CSS file:                
            </p>
            <code>
                @media screen and (max-width: 800px){ }                
            </code>
            <p>
                This code will apply all the styles within the media query to the page when the width of
                the screen is not wider than 800 px. To achieve a different layout for different screen sizes or
                devices, you need to specify a media query for the different size ranges. To explore this, use
                the blog layout that was created in Objective 4.3 using a grid layout. The default layout of the
                blog is shown in Figure 4-48. However, as the screen size gets smaller, the blog gets compacted
                to the point that it might not be readable or, depending on the amount of content,
                will require awkward scrolling on a device. To accommodate the different screen sizes, update
                your CSS code to include media queries. The following code adds a media query to apply the
                default layout to larger screens such as desktops or laptops:                
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                The media query does not require that a smart phone or tablet be in use, only that the
                view port of the page is within the query parameters. To test this code, simply resize your
                browser window beyond the defined sizes to see the page change its layout dynamically.            
            </p>
            <p>
                So far the CSS is working great. The only problem is you have a lot of CSS code in a single
                page. Typically, a website has multiple pages with styles shared across different pages. As
                a result, you will likely be linking an external CSS file to your HTML page. The link element
                supports media queries as well, which in turn lets you share a CSS file across multiple pages.
                For example, you might want to change the font-size of the text throughout your site based
                on the view port size. To achieve this, move the CSS from each media query into its own CSS
                file and link in your CSS files in the following way:                
            </p>
            <code>
                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-width: 1200px)" href="Desktop.css"/&gt;<br>
                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (max-width: 1199px) and (min-width: 401px)"
                ref="tablet.css"/&gt;<br>
                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (max-width: 400px)" href="phone.css"/&gt;<br>                
            </code>
            <p>
                With the CSS linked in this fashion, you can add and modify the styles for the different
                view ports centrally for your entire website.                
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Hiding or disabling controls</h2>
            <p>
                The ability to modify the user interface positioning using media queries as shown in the last
                section is very useful. In addition, some layouts might just not work in some view ports. In
                this case, you might want to complete hide controls or disable controls. HTML elements are
                visible by default. However, they can be made invisible by setting the visibility CSS property as
                shown in the following code:                
            </p>
            <code>
                .myhiddenelements {<br>
                    &nbsp;visibility:hidden;<br>
                    }
            </code>
            <p>
                By setting the visibility to hidden, the control is not visible to the end user of the webpage.
                When hiding an element using the visibility property, the overall layout still behaves as
                though the element is there. If you prefer to have the element hidden and the layout behave
                as though it is not there, the display property should be used as shown in the following code:                
            </p>
            <code>
                .myhiddenelements {<br>
                    &nbsp;display: none;<br>
                    }                
            </code>
            <p>
                With the display property, the element is not visible and the layout is not affected by it.
                If you do not want to hide the element but only make it disabled such that the user can
                see it but cannot perform any action on it, you need to add the attribute directly to the HTML
                element. As such, you can define a CSS class that you can apply to any elements that you
                want to have disabled:                                
            </p>
            <code>
                .disableIt
            </code>
            <p>
                Now that you have a CSS class called .disableIt, you can apply this class to any elements
                that you want to disable. In this case, you want to disable a button element, so apply the class
                to the button element as shown here:                
            </p>
            <code>
                &lt;button id="myButton" class="disableIt" &gt;My Button&lt;/button&gt;                
            </code>
            <p>
                The last step is to create some JavaScript that finds all the controls with this class assigned
                to it and adds the disabled attribute to them. The following code demonstrates this:                
            </p>
            <code>
                $("document").ready(function (e) {<br>
                    &nbsp;$(".disableIt").attr("disabled", "disabled");<br>
                    });                
            </code>
            <p>
                This script has the same net effect as putting the attribute directly on the button element
                as shown here:                
            </p>
            <code>
                &lt;button id="myButton" disabled="disabled"&gt;My Button&lt;/button&gt;
            </code>
            <p>
                When you have many elements that you would like to disable, it is much easier to create a
                CSS class, apply it to the elements, then by using jQuery, apply the disabled attribute to them
                all.                
            </p>
