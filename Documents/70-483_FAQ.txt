Frequently asked questions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Given the difficulties in synchronization and management, is it worth the effort to implement applications using multiple tasks?

Yes, because using multiple tasks allows you to fully utilize multiple CPUs, Cores. In order to fully utilize multiple CPUs
your work must be able to be split in multiple tasks (parallel processing). Another advantage of using multiple tasks      
is that it improves responsiveness of UI.  

Book answer:
Breaking an application into separate tasks is not just something that you
would do to make use of the performance advantages. Tasks provide a very
useful level of abstraction. Once the communication between the tasks has
been designed, each one can be worked on independently. Partitioning an
application into tasks can be seen as a natural extension of component-based
design.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Is it still worth the effort to use multiple-tasks if you only have one processor in your computer?

Yes it can improve responsiveness of UI, for example WPF has one UI thread, if this thread is busy with long calculation task, 
the UI is not updated and not responsive to user.

Book answer:
Consider a program that is performing a numeric analysis of a particular
data set. Once the data has been loaded into memory the time it takes to be
processed is determined by the speed of the CPU. We would say that this
program was cpu bound. If a system only has one processor, converting the
program to use a multi-threaded implementation would not improve the rate
at which the data is processed. However, consider a program that is
continuously interacting with the file system. We would say this application
was IO (input/output) bound, in that the rate at which it can work is
determined by performance of the file system. When an IO bound program
is active it will frequently be unable to do any work as it waits file
transactions to complete. A multi-threaded solution would be able to
perform processing at the times when one task was waiting for an
input/output operation to complete.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) What kind of applications benefit the most from the use of multi-tasking applications?

Applications that can split calculation into multiple tasks (parallelism),
so you can fully utilize the multiple CPUs, Cores to perform calculations.

Book answer:
A CPU bound application will benefit from a multi-tasking approach if the
host system has more than one CPU. Note that the programmer may have to
spend some effort re-working the application to allow it to work over
multiple tasks. An application that contains a mix of CPU bound and IO
bound tasks can benefit most from a multi-threading approach as there will
always be something for the processor to do.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) Are there situations when you really should not use multi-tasking?

If you have a calculation thread that doesnt have processing gaps such as I/O (CPU bound processes), therefore you want the thread to remain on the CPU as long as possible.           

Generally speaking, you would only want to use this type of single-processor multithreading when the task running under the thread will have long gaps in which the processor could be doing something else. For example, I/O from hard disk (and, consequently, from a database system that uses one) is many orders of magnitude slower than memory access. Network access can also be slow, as another example. Multithreading could allow another process to be running while waiting for these slow (compared to the processor) operations to complete.
Remember that there is some overhead in starting processes on threads, so only use threads when the advantages of doing so outweigh this overhead.
Consider also the cost that multithreading has to the maintainability of your application. Threaded applications can be harder to debug, for example.

Book answer:
The asynchronous nature of a multi-threaded application makes it very hard
to guarantee that a given operation will be completed within a specified
time. Threads can be given priority levels, but these are not hard and fast.
Applications with critical timing requirements should not be implemented
using multiple threads.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) I need a background process that is going to compress a large number of data files. Should I use a task or a thread?

You can use parallel.Foreach/parallel.For to compress a large number of data files, it uses tasks, it does does not overwelm the device by creating too much tasks.
Compressing a file is a CPU process that doesnt have processing gaps, at the end of compression, the file needs to be written to the same disk I/O.

Book answer:
When choosing between tasks and threads you need to consider what you
want to achieve. Tasks are good for background processes. Threads can be
used for background processes but can also run as foreground processes.
Tasks are easier to create. In this situation a Task would make the most
sense, because it would be easier to create and will never need to operate in
the foreground.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) What is the difference between the WaitAll and WaitAny method when waiting for a large number of tasks to complete?

WaitAll returns until all tasks specified (passed as argument) are complete, WaitAny returns when one of the tasks is complete.

Book answer:
The WaitAll method will return when all the tasks that are running have
completed. The WaitAny method will return when the first of the running
tasks completes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7) What is the difference between a continuation task and a child task?

A continuation task starts when its parent task is complete. Child tasks are created when one or more tasks are attached to a parent task, 
the parent task only completes when its child tasks are complete.

Book answer:
A continuation task is a task that is started when an existing task completes.
A child task is created by a parent task and executes independently of the
parent.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8) What is the difference between the WaitAll and WhenAll methods?

Task.WaitAll blocks the current thread until everything has completed.
Task.WhenAll returns a task which represents the action of waiting until everything has completed.
await Task.WhenAll(tasks);, means your method will continue when everything's completed, but you won't tie up a thread to just hang around until that time.

Book answer:
The WaitAll method accepts a list of Task references as an argument and
returns when all the tasks have completed. The WaitAll method does not
return a result. The WhenAll method accepts a list of Task references as
an argument and returns a Task that delivers the results returned by those
tasks. The WhenAll method is can be awaited, which allows it to be used in
asynchronous code.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9) What happens when a method call is awaited?

The await keyword represents “a statement of intent” to perform an action. The keyword precedes a call of a method that will return the task to be
performed. The compiler will generate code that will cause the async method to return to the caller at the point the await is reached. It will then go on to
generate code that will perform the awaited action asynchronously and then continue with the body of the async method. 

Book answer:
Methods that can be awaited return a reference to a Task. When a program
performs an await in an asynchronous method, the asynchronous method
returns immediately. When the task returned by the awaited method
completes the remainder of the asynchronous method will complete. A good
example of a situation where this can be used to good effect is in user
interfaces. A user interface method, for example the code that implements a
behavior when a button is clicked in the user interface, must return as
quickly as possible. Otherwise the user interface will become unresponsive.
By using await the button click handler can complete and return, while the
action initiated by the button click runs in parallel.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10) What is special about a concurrent collection?

Concurrent collection are thread save, this means that you can update and read the collection from different threads.
The collection is managed so that threads access and update the data in a synchronized way, no race conditions. 
This means that an action by one process on a given collection entry cannot be interrupted by another process.

Book answer:
A concurrent collection is one which has behaviors that can be used by
multiple processes at the same time. Some concurrent collections, for
example ConcurrentDictionary, have additional behaviors that allow
processes to only perform updates to data stored in the collection when it is
valid to do so.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11) Will program errors caused by a poor multithreading implementation always manifest themselves as faults in an application?

No, poor multithreading implementation can result in corrupt data such as corrupt calculations, and deadlocks in the application.

Book answer:
There is no guarantee that the conditions that might cause a race condition to
cause a problem will arise. Natural delays in a system might mean that
events occur in an order that means race conditions do not cause a problem.
For example, if one task is writing a file to a disk, there is a good chance that
this task will take longer to complete than another which is updating the
display. However, problems might suddenly appear when the user buys a
faster disk-drive or installs more memory. This might speed up the write
action and cause the application to become unstable. In fact, these symptoms
are the best way of diagnosing problems like this. The first question you
should ask a user whose program has suddenly become unreliable is “Have
you made any changes to the underlying system?”     
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12) Does the fact that the processor is suddenly at 100% loading indicate that two processes are stuck in a deadly embrace?

When a process is in a deadlock, the process does not have 100% CPU loading. When tasks are in a deadlock, each task is waiting for the other’s lock
object, and neither can continue. Note that this is not the same as creating an infinite loop, in which a program repeats a sequence of statements forever.
You will not find that the program in a deadlock will use up the entire CPU in the same way as an infinitely repeated loop will do. Instead, these two tasks will
sit in memory unable to do anything.    

Book answer:
The simplest form of deadlock occurs when two tasks are waiting for locks
to be released by each other. More complex deadlocks can be spread over a
larger number of tasks. However, when a deadlock occurs a program is not
executing very rapidly, in fact nothing is happening at all, all the tasks are
waiting for each other, and the application is taking no processor time at all.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13) Could you make an object thread safe by enclosing the body code of all the methods in lock statements to make all the method actions atomic?

Book answer:
Making all method calls in an object atomic is a very heavy handed and
dangerous approach to achieving thread safety. It may well make an
application vulnerable to deadlocks and could also remove any performance
advantage that would be gained by using multiple processors. Furthermore,
it does not protect against issues caused by the use of reference parameters
to a method.     
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14) If you’re not sure about potential race conditions, is it best to add lock statements around critical sections of your code “just in case?”

No you need to be sure when use lock statements, because this can lead to deadlocks and performance decline of the application.
Lock statements should enclose code as small as possible else the performance of the application could suffer because
other threads could not access the locked code/methods. You also need to remember that when a task is running code protected by a lock,
the task is in a position to block other tasks. This is similar to how a person taking a long time in the restroom will cause a long queue of people waiting to
use it. Code in a lock should be as short as possible and should not contain any actions that might take a while to complete. As an example, your program
should never perform input/output during a locked block of code.

Book answer:
Adding lock statements around critical pieces of code without thinking
about what the code actually does is very dangerous. It may well lead to
performance bottlenecks and deadlocks. It is very difficult to add thread
safety to a program once it has been written. The only sure-fire way I’ve
found of writing thread safe code is to design it that way from the start.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15) Should a task always generate an exception if it is cancelled?

No, you can cancel a task using a cancellationtoken, but if you have continuation tasks that depend on cancelation exception
you need to throw a cancelation exception when a task is cancelled. Or if you have custom code that takes action when a cancelation exception is thrown.       

Book answer:
A task can be cancelled “silently”, in which case it will just end.
Alternatively, it can be made to generate an exception when cancelled. From
a design perspective I tend to regard cancelling a task as an exceptional
action and would therefore expect there to be some way of propagating this
event through the system so that it can be registered in some way.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16) Could you make an application that automatically cancelled deadlocked processes?

A deadlocked process does not uses CPU, when a process does not use CPU for a longtime you can stop it using taskmanager (Windows API).

Book answer:
If you use the Monitor construction to manage entry into atomic actions it is
possible for a task to retain control when it fails to get a lock and enter an
atomic action. You can even establish a time-out by adding a timeout value
to a call of the TryEnter method to try and enter an atomic action. It
would therefore be possible for a program to recognize that a given lock had
been unavailable for a more than a certain length of time. It could then use a
cancellation token to try and stop a task that might have obtained the
synchronization object. Of course, this would only work correctly if the task
that is causing the deadlock is checking its cancellation token while it is
waiting for its lock. In other words, yes it would be possible to do this, but it
would entail a lot of extra work. The best way to avoid deadlocks is to make
sure that they are not present in the design of your system.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17) Is it necessary to have both the while and the do-while looping construction?

The do-while performs the loop at least once and then checks the specified condition, 
the while performs the loop depending on the specified condition. So both loop construction are
different and needed. But they are not both necessary, you can skip the do-while.

Book answer:
The while and do-while loop constructions differ in only one respect. The
while construction will not execute any code if the control condition is false,
whereas the do-while construction tests the control condition at the
completion of the loop, so the code controlled by it is always executed once,
even if the control condition is false at the start. At the expense of a slightly
more complicated program, it is possible to only use one form of the loop
construction, both are provided to make the programmers life slightly easier.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18) Is a break statement the only way of exiting a loop before it completes?

No, you can use the goto statement in addition you can skip a loop iteration using continue. 

Book answer:
If a break is used in a loop the program will exit the loop at that point. It is
also possible to exit a loop by returning from the method in which the loop
is declared. Finally a program will exit a loop if it throws an exception
within the loop.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19) Can you identify a situation where you would use a for loop to iterate through a collection rather than a foreach loop?

If you dont want to iterate through all the collection you can use for loop, in addition in order to use the  
foreach loop, the collection you want to iterate must implement the IEnumerable interface.

Book answer:
A foreach construction provides a very convenient way to express a need
to enumerate each of the items in a collection. However, each enumerated
item is provided on a “read-only” basis. If the program wants to change the
value of an enumerated item it is necessary to use a for loop to access each
item. Note that if the foreach construction is iterating through a collection
of reference types it is perfectly permissible to change properties of each
iterated item.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20) The and(&) logical operator and the or (|) logical operator have “short circuit” versions (&& and ||), 
which only evaluate elements until it can be determined whether or not a given expression is true or false. Why does the
exclusive-or(^) operator not have a short circuit version?

The exclusive-or(^) operator needs to evaluate both conditions, because only one condition must be true.
To determine that only one condition is true, you need to evaluate both conditions.

Book answer:
There is no short-circuit version of the exclusive-or operator because it is
not possible to determine whether an exclusive-or is true by just examining
one of the operands. Remember that an exclusive-or operation returns true if
the two operands are different. It is not possible to make this determination
by just examining one of the operands.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21) Is it true that each C# operator has a behavior that is the same for every context in which it is used?

No, The context of the use of an operator determines the actual behavior that the operator will exhibit. For example, the addition operator can be used to add two numeric operands together, or concatenate two strings together. In addition you can also implement operator overloading to implement your own custom operator behaviour for a given type.    

Book answer:
No. C# operators have different behaviors depending on the context in which
they are used. The integer and floating-point types are held in quite different
ways in the memory of the computer. When arithmetic operators are used
between these types the compiler will select the correct operator to be used
depending on the type of the operands in the expression.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22) Can you always be certain of the precise sequence of operations when an expression is evaluated?

Yes, because each operator has a priority or precedence that determines when it is performed during expression evaluation. This precedence can be overridden by
the use of parenthesis; elements enclosed in parenthesis are evaluated first. Operators also have an associability, which gives the order (left to right or right
to left) in which they are evaluated if a number of them appear together.

Book answer:
The C# compiler guarantees that expressions will be evaluated according to
the rules of precedence and associability for the operators in the expression.
However, the precise sequence in which the operations are performed is not
something that a programmer can make any assumptions about.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
23) How does a delegate actually work?

A delegate is a function pointer, it directs input and output to the linked function.

Book answer:
A delegate is a type that can refer to a method in an object with a particular
signature. A delegate can also contain lists of method references. A delegate
is called in exactly the same way as the method it can refer to. If the delegate
contains a list of method references, each method is called in no particular
order. The base type of all delegate objects is the Delegate class.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
24) What happens if a delegate is assigned to a delegate?

Only delegates of the same type can be assigned to each other. If this happens the delegate is assigned a new reference to a method that the other delegate was pointing to.    

Book answer:
Delegates can be assigned to other delegates, as long as they have the same
signature. Delegates can also be added to the subscribers of a multi-cast
delegate.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
25) What happens if a delegate is assigned to itself?

Nothing, you assign the delegate reference to itself. 

Book answer:
A delegate can be assigned to itself, but this is not a sensible thing to do. If
the delegate is ever called the program will enter an infinite loop.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
26) Is there an upper limit for the number of subscribers that a publisher delegate can have?

It looks like there is no limit.

Book answer:
There is no upper limit, over and above the capacity of the data structure in
the Delegate class which holds references to subscribers.    
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
27) What does the lambda operator (=>) actually do?

It specifies the function that the delegate is pointing to.

Book answer:
The lambda operator (=>) separates the items that go into the expression (the
input parameters) from the statement or statement block that implements the
behavior of the lambda expression.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
28) Can code in a lambda expression access data from the enclosing code?

Yes lambda expression can access data that is in scope.

Book answer:
Code in a lambda expression can access variables declared in code enclosing
the lambda expression. Note that code in a lambda expression is not
executed when the lambda expression is declared, a reference to the lambda
expression may be followed at a much later time. The C# compiler will
generate code that maintains variables used by the code in the lambda
expression even if they would normally be out of scope at the time the code
in the lambda expression is performed (this is called Closure, my note).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
29) Is a method receiving a date of “31st of February” something that should cause an exception?

This is not valid data from application user or from other system/interface. This error should not cause an exception, 
instead the application should validate the date and if not a valid date then ignore it and ask for a new date. 

Book answer:
It all depends on the context of the action. If the date is being entered by the
user, it is reasonable for the program to display an error message and request
that the date be re-entered. In this case no exception will be thrown.
However, if the date is being supplied to a method that is expected to create
a transaction with this date, it is reasonable for that method to throw an
exception if given an invalid date value, as it would not be meaningful for
the method to generate anything. Throwing an exception, rather than
returning an error code or a null value, is a way of ensuring that the program
will fail in a properly noticeable way and maximizes the chances of the
mistake being detected. From a design perspective, the need for exceptions
in this situation would be completely removed if the method creating the
transaction was passed a DateTime structure. This can only contain a valid date.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
30) Should I make sure that all exceptions are always caught by my program?

You should make sure that your code deals with any exceptions that may be thrown by methods, propagating the exception onward if necessary to ensure that
exception events are not hidden from different parts of your application. If you do not catch an Exception, the foreground process/program will be stopped. 

Book answer:
No. There is only one thing worse than a program that fails, and that is a
program that fails silently. You might think it is a good idea to wrap your
entire program in a try construction. This would mean that the program
would never fail due to an uncaught exception. However, it would also make
the program impossible to debug and prone to failing silently. You should
take care to catch all the exceptions that you know how to deal with, and let
the remaining ones pass through so that they are either caught by layers
above (in a managed and designed way) or propagate as errors which can be
caught and dealt with.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
31) Can you return to the code after an exception has been caught?

Yes depending on where the error was caught, but if its a minor error you can continue with the application. In contrast an uncaught exception stops the application.
Note that if you catch an exception without taking specific actions to recover from it can leave your program in an indeterminate state.

Book answer:
There is no way to return to the statements after an exception has been
thrown. If a program wants to re-try code that may throw exceptions, this
code must be placed in a loop.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
32) Why do we need the finally clause? Can’t code to be run after the code in a try clause just be put straight after the end of the catch?

Code after the catch statement is not guaranteed to execute in case of exception/error in the catch clause.
In contrast, code in a finally statement is guaranteed to execute in case of exception/error.
In addition the catch block can have a return statement resulting in that further code will not be executed.  

Book answer:
We need a finally clause because code in the catch clause may return from a
method or throw other exceptions, in which case the program will not reach
the statements following the catch. The finally clause is guaranteed to be
executed in all circumstances.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
33) Should my application always use custom exceptions?

No you should only use custom exceptions when standard exceptions cannot meet your requirements

Book answer:
The standard Exception type provides a great deal of flexibility; it contains a
Dictionary which can be filled with name-value pairs that describe an error.
Custom exception types can be useful if none of the existing exception types
are suitable for the exception context. Because different catch clauses can be
allocated to different exception types, they also make exceptions easier to
manage.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
34) You need to build a new application, and you look into multithreading capabili-ties. Your application consists of a client application that communicates with a web server.

Network access can be slow. Multithreading could allow another process to be running while waiting for the slow download(compared to the processor) operations to complete.

Book answer:
Multithreading can improve the responsiveness in a client application. The UI thread can
process requests from the user while background threads execute other operations.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
35) What is the difference between CPU and I/O bound operations?

A CPU bound operation is an operation that only needs the CPU to complete its task. The speed of a CPU bound operation can be increased by using multiple CPUs /Cores (split CPU bound operation into multiple Tasks that can be scheduled on different cores, if nature of operation/calculation allows this)               
A I/O bound operation, means that the operation is performing a lot of I/O operations (for example write to disk) which can take a relative long time (compared to CPU cycle),
during I/O operation you don't want to bind a thread waiting for the I/O operation, you want to suspend the thread and schedule another CPU bound thread.         

Book answer:
A CPU-bound operation needs a thread to execute. In a client application, it can make
sense to execute a CPU-bound operation on another thread to improve responsiveness.
In a server application, you don’t want an extra thread for a CPU-bound operation.
Asynchronous I/O operations don’t require a thread while executing. Using
asynchronous I/O frees the current thread to do other work and improves scalability.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
36) Does using multithreading with the TPL offer the same advantages for your server application?

For server application it is necessary to spawn a lot of threads to serve client requests. By using TPL the server uses a threadpool which cannot overwhelm
the device by spawning too much threads.      

Book answer:
Using multithreading in a server environment can help you distribute operations
over multiple CPUs. This way, you can improve performance. Using the TPL to create
another thread to execute a CPU-bound operation while the originating thread has to
wait for it won’t help you with increasing performance.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
37) How can you orchestrate your locking code to avoid deadlocks?

You can for example use Monitor to acquire a lock with a timeout. If the lock is not acquired within the timeout, the code continues and does not further wait on the lock.       
Make sure that the smallest amount of code is locked.       

Book answer:
It’s important to make sure that all locking follows the same order when locking multiple
objects. As soon as you start locking dependent objects in different orders, you
start getting deadlocks.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
38) How can the Interlocked class help you avoid deadlocks?

CompareExchange method perform an atomic action and does not lock a variable for a long time??

Book answer:
The Interlocked class can help you to execute small, atomic operations without the
need for locking. When you use locking a lot for these kind of operations, you can
replace them with the Interlocked statement.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
39) What is the disadvantage of using goto? How can you avoid using the goto statement?

The use of goto statements makes the flow in a program more difficult to comprehend. Avoid goto statements by better method design. 

Book answer:
Using the goto statement makes your code much harder to read because the application
flow jumps around. goto is mostly used in looping statements. You can then
replace goto with while or do-while.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
40) Which statement can you use to improve the long if statements?

You can for example use a switch statement. 

Book answer:
The switch statement can be used to improve long if statements.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
41) What are the differences between the for and foreach statement? When should you use which?

In order to use a foreach loop on a collection, the collection must implement IEnumerable, a for loop does not have this limitation.      
In a foreach loop you cannot modify value types (Reference types can be modified), in a for loop you can also modify value types.     

Book answer:
The for statement can be used to iterate over a collection by using an index. You can
modify the collection while iterating. You need to use the index to retrieve each item.
foreach is syntactic sugar over the iterator pattern. You don’t use an index; instead the
compiler gives you a variable that points to each iteration item.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
42) You are working on a desktop application that consists of multiple forms. Those
forms show different views of the same data and they should update in real time.
Your application is extensible, and third parties can add plug-ins that contain their
own views of the data. Should you use delegates or events in this system? How can this help you?

In order to provide data in a (loose coupled way) to third parties plug-ins you need to use events, such as: public event EventHandler<CustomEventArgs> OnEvent; 
In which the EventHandler is a delegate: delegate EventHandler<TEventArgs>(object sender, TEventArgs arg)    
Plug-ins can subscribe to an event in which it is interested in, when the event is fired/published the handler in the plug-in is executed.        
Advantage of using events is that it reduces the CPU usage, you dont have to pool data for a change.  

Book answer:
Events are a nice layer on top of delegates that make them easier and safer to use. In
this case, you should use events to make sure that other users won’t be able to clear all
subscriptions. It also makes sure that they can’t raise the event on their own. They can
only listen to changes.
The advantage of using an event system in an application like this is that you can
achieve loose coupling. Your forms don’t have to know anything about each other. The
class that monitors data changes and raises the event doesn’t have to know how many
forms are listening and how they look. Third-party plug-ins can easily subscribe to the
events at runtime to be able to respond to changes without tightly coupling to the
existing system.

43)You are designing a new application and you want to implement a proper errorhandling
strategy. You are discussing the topic with some colleagues, and one of
them says that you should use regular error codes to signal errors because that’s
faster and your company has used it in the past.
You are also having a discussion about when to create a custom exception and when
to use the built-in .NET Framework exceptions. Explain to your colleague the advantages of Exceptions compared to error codes.

The error infrastructure within c# is based on exceptions, exceptions can contain more information than just the errorcode such as stacktrace.   
Furthermore you can pass/rethrow Exceptions to the upper layers. In summary Exceptions give you more flexibilty and information than error codes in handling errors.   

Book answer:
Exceptions are objects, so they can store extra information that can’t be done with only
an error code. The .NET Framework also offers special support for dealing with exceptions.
For example, you can use catch blocks to handle certain types of exceptions and
you can use a finally block to make sure that certain code will always run.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
44) When should you create a custom exception?

If existing exception dont meet your requirements you can define your own custom exceptions that inherit from exception.  

Book answer:
You should create a custom exception only if you expect developers to handle it or perform
custom logging. If a developer won’t be able to fix the specific error, it won’t make any
sense to create a more specific exception. Custom logging can happen when you throw
more detailed exceptions, so developers can differentiate between the errors that happen.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
45) You have a lot of items that need to be processed. For each item, you need to perform a complex calculation. Which technique should you use?
A. You create a Task for each item and then wait until all tasks are finished.
B. You use Parallel.For to process all items concurrently.
C. You use async/await to process all items concurrently.
D. You add all items to a BlockingCollection and process them on a thread created by the Thread class.

B) You can use Parallel.For it creates/reuses threads to concurrently process the items. Parallel.For does not overwhelm the device by creating too many threads.     
Parallel.For creates Task to process the items, background thread. 

Book answer:
Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: Manually creating and managing tasks is not necessary. The Parallel
class takes care of this and uses the optimal configuration options.
B. Correct: Parallel.For is ideal for executing parallel operations on a large set of
items that have to do a lot of work.
C. Incorrect: async/await does not process items concurrently. Instead it waits until
the current task has finished and then continues executing the code.
D. Incorrect: The BlockingCollection can be used to share data between multiple
threads. Using one producer and one consumer thread, however, won’t improve
scalability. The Parallel class is designed for this scenario and should be used.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
46) You are creating a complex query that doesn’t require any particular order and you want to run it in parallel. Which method should you use? 
A. AsParallel
B. AsSequential
C. AsOrdered
D. WithDegreeOfParallelism

A) AsParallel  concurrently executes a plinq query, note the order of the output is different from the order of the input.    

Book answer:
Correct answer: A
A. Correct: AsParallel makes a sequential query parallel if the runtime thinks this will
improve performance.
B. Incorrect: AsSequential is used to make a parallel query sequential again.
C. Incorrect: AsOrdered is used to make sure that the results of a parallel query are
returned in order.
D. Incorrect: WithDegreeOfParallelism is used to specify how many threads the parallel
query should use.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
47) You are working on an ASP.NET application that retrieves some data from another web
server and then writes the response to the database. Should you use async/await?
A. No, both operations depend on external factors. You need to wait before they are finished.
B. No, in a server application you don’t have to use async/await. It’s only for responsiveness on the client.
C. Yes, this will free your thread to serve other requests while waiting for the I/O to complete.
D. Yes, this put your thread to sleep while waiting for I/O so that it doesn’t use any CPU.

C) By using a Task in combination with async/await you can create dedicated Task to perform a specific task and when the task is I/O bound, the task can be suspenden in favour of CPU bound tasks.    

Book answer:
Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: Because you have to wait for external factors (the database and web
response), you should use async/await to free your thread. That way your thread
can do some other work while waiting for the external responses to come back.
B. Incorrect: Async/await can be used to improve responsiveness on the client but
it can also be used in server scenarios. Especially when waiting for an I/O-bound
operation, you can use asynchronous code to free the thread from waiting.
C. Correct: The operating system waits for the I/O request to complete and then
activates a thread that can process the response. In the meantime, the thread can
do other work.
D. Incorrect: Async/await does not put your thread to sleep in an I/O-bound situation.
Instead, your thread can process other work while the operating system
monitors the status of the request. When the request finishes, a thread is used
to process the response. With a CPU-bound operation, your thread waits for the
operation to finish on another thread.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
48)You want to synchronize access by using a lock statement. On which member do you lock?
A. this
B. string _lock = “mylock”
C. int _lock = 42;
D. object _lock = new object();

D)

Book answer:
Correct answer: D
A. Incorrect: You should never lock on this. Another part of your code may already
be using your object to execute a lock.
B. Incorrect: You shouldn’t use a string for locking. With string-interning, one object
can be used for multiple strings, so you would be locking on an object that is also
in use in other locations.
C. Incorrect: Locking on a value type will generate a compile error. The value type
will be boxed each time you lock on it, resulting in a unique lock each time.
D. Correct: A private lock of type object is the best choice.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
49) You need to implement cancellation for a long running task. Which object do you pass to the task?
A. CancellationTokenSource
B. CancellationToken
C. Boolean isCancelled variable
D. Volatile

B)

Book answer:
Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: The CancellationTokenSource is used to generate a CancellationToken.
The token should be passed to the task, and the CancellationTokenSource can then
be used to request cancellation on the token.
B. Correct: A CancellationToken generated by a CancellationTokenSource should be
passed to the task.
C. Incorrect: A Boolean variable can be used to cancel a task, but it’s not the preferred
way. A CancellationToken offers more flexibility and should be used.
D. Incorrect: The volatile keyword should be used to signal to the compiler that the
order of reads and writes on a field is important and that the compiler shouldn’t
change it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
50) You are implementing a state machine in a multithreaded class. You need to check
what the current state is and change it to the new one on each step. Which method do you use?
A. Volatile.Write(ref currentState)
B. Interlocked.CompareExchange(ref currentState, ref newState, expectedState)
C. Interlocked.Exchange(ref currentState, newState)
D. Interlocked.Decrement(ref newState)

B) The function checks if the current state is as expected, if so then it is modified to the new state.  

Book answer:
Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: Volatile.Write is used to signal to the compiler that writing the value to a
field should happen at that exact location.
B. Correct: CompareExchange will see whether the current state is correct and it will
then change it to the new state in one atomic operation.
C. Incorrect: Exchange only changes the value; it doesn’t check to see whether the
current state is correct.
D. Incorrect: Decrement is used to subtract one off the value in an atomic operation.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
51) You need to iterate over a collection in which you know the number of items. You need to remove certain items from the collection. Which statement do you use?
A. switch
B. foreach
C. for
D. goto

C) The foreach does not allow you to remove items from the collection in contrast to for loop.      

Book answer:
Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: switch is used as a decision statement. You map a value to certain labels
to execute specific code; it doesn’t iterate over collections.
B. Incorrect: Although the foreach statement can be used to iterate over a collection;
it doesn’t allow changes to the collection while iterating.
C. Correct: With for, you can iterate over the collection while modifying it. It’s your
own job to make sure that the index stays correct.
D. Incorrect: goto is a jump statement that should be avoided.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
52) You have a lot of checks in your application for null values. If a value is not null, you want to call a method on it. You want to simplify your code. Which technique do you use?
A. for
B. Conditional operator
C. Null-coalescing operator A = B ?? C (If B is null, it assigns C to A, otherwise it assigns B to A)
D. The short-circuiting behavior of the and operator

D) object?.Method(), only if the object != null will the method be called. Using the short-circuiting behavior of the and operator => object != null && object.method();   

Book answer:

Correct answer: D
A. Incorrect: for is an iteration statement that can’t be used to check for null values.
B. Incorrect: The conditional operator can be used to shorten if statements. It’s not
useful to conditionally call a method.
C. Incorrect: The null-coalescing operator does check for null values but it’s used
to provide a default value. It’s not useful when calling a method if the value is not null.
D. Correct: Short-circuiting enables you to see whether a value is null and call a
member on it in one and statement. If the left value is null, the right operand won’t
be executed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
53) You are processing some data from over the network. You use a HasNext and Read method to retrieve the data. You need to run some code on each item. What do you use?
A. for
B. foreach
C. while
D. do-while

C) while(HasNext) { item = ReadMethod; Run(item); }

Book answer:
Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: A for statement is most useful when iterating over a collection in which
you know the number of items beforehand.
B. Incorrect: foreach can be used only on types that implement IEnumerable. It can’t
be easily used with your two custom methods.
C. Correct: You can use while (o.HasNext) { var i = o.Read(); } to process the items.
When o.HasNext returns false, you automatically end the loop.
D. Incorrect: Do-while will run the code at least once. If there are no items on the
network, the code doesn’t have to run.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
54) You have a private method in your class and you want to make invocation of the method possible by certain callers. What do you do?

A. Make the method public.
B. Use an event so outside users can be notified when the method is executed.
C. Use a method that returns a delegate to authorized callers.
D. Declare the private method as a lambda.

C) You can have a delegate to the private method, which you return from a method after authorization.
public delegate void DelegatePrivateMethod(object arg);
public DelegatePrivateMethod AuthorizationMethod(Object authorization)
{
	if(Check(authorization))
	{
		return new DelegatePrivateMethod(PrivateMethod); 
	}
	else
	{
		return null;
	}
}
 
Book answer:
Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: Making the method public gives access to all users of your class.
B. Incorrect: This doesn’t give users of your class the ability to execute the method.
C. Correct: The method can see whether the caller is authorized and then return a
delegate to the private method that can be invoked at will.
D. Incorrect: Changing the method to a lambda doesn’t change the fact that outside
users can’t access the method.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
55) You have declared an event on your class, and you want outside users of your class to raise this event. What do you do?

A. Make the event public.
B. Add a public method to your class that raises the event.
C. Use a public delegate instead of an event.
D. Use a custom event accessor to give access to outside users.

B)

Book answer:
Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: The compiler restricts the use of events outside of the class where it’s
defined. They can only add and remove subscribers. Only the class itself can raise
the event.
B. Correct: The public method can be called by outside users of your class. Internally
it can raise the event.
C. Incorrect: Using a delegate does allow it to be invoked from outside the class.
However, you lose the protection that an event gives you. A public delegate can be
completely modified by outside users without any restrictions.
D. Incorrect: Canonical name (CNAME) records map an alias or nickname to the real
or canonical name that might lie outside the current zone.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
56) You are using a multicast delegate with multiple subscribers. You want to make sure that all subscribers are notified, even if an exception is thrown. What do you do?

A. Manually raise the events by using GetInvocationList.
B. Wrap the raising of the event in a try/catch.
C. Nothing. This is the default behavior.
D. Let subscribers return true or false instead of throwing an exception.


foreach(Delegate del in multicastDelegate.GetInvocationList())
{
	try
	{
		del?.Invoke();
	}
	catch(Exception ex)
	{
		//Handle exception 
		For example aggregate the exception in a list
	}
}

A and B
Correct answer: A
Book answer:
A. Correct: You can handle each individual error and make sure that all subscribers
are called.
B. Incorrect: Wrapping the raising of the event in one try/catch will still cause the
invocation to stop at the first exception. Later subscribers won’t be notified.
C. Incorrect: By default, the invocation of subscribers stops when the first unhandled
exception happens in one of the subscribers.
D. Incorrect: Exceptions are the preferred way of dealing with errors. Returning a
value from each event still requires you to invoke them manually one by one to check the return value.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
57) You are checking the arguments of your method for illegal null values. If you encounter
a null value, which exception do you throw?

A. ArgumentException.
B. InvalidOperationException.
C. NullReferenceException.
D. ArgumentNullException.

D)

Book answer:
Correct answer: D
A. Incorrect: Although the exception has to do with an argument to your method,
you should throw the more specialized ArgumentNullException.
B. Incorrect: InvalidOperationException should be used when your class is not in the
correct state to handle a request.
C. Incorrect: NullReferenceException is thrown by the runtime when you try to reference
a null value.
D. Correct: ArgumentNullException is the most specialized exception that you can use
to tell which argument was null and what you expect.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
58) Your code catches an IOException when a file cannot be accessed. You want to give more information to the caller of your code. What do you do? 

A. Change the message of the exception and rethrow the exception.
B. Throw a new exception with extra information that has the IOException as InnerException.
C. Throw a new exception with more detailed info.
D. Use throw to rethrow the exception and save the call stack.

B)

Book answer:
Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: The Message property of an exception is read-only. You can’t change it
after the exception is created.
B. Correct: The new exception can contain extra info. Setting the InnerException
makes sure that the original exception stays available.
C. Incorrect: Throwing a brand-new exception loses the original exception and the
information that it had.
D. Incorrect: Using throw without an identifier will rethrow the original exception
while maintaining the stack trace, but it won’t add any extra information.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
59) You are creating a custom exception called LogonFailedException. Which constructors should you at least add? (Choose all that apply.)

A. LogonFailed()
B. LogonFailed(string message)
C. LogonFailed(string message, Exception innerException)
D. LogonFailed(Exception innerException)

A, B, C

Book answer:
Correct answers: A, B, C
A. Correct: You should always add a default empty constructor.
B. Correct: A second constructor should take a descriptive message of why the error
occurred.
C. Correct: An InnerException can be set to correlate two exceptions and show what
the original error was.
D. Incorrect: You don’t have to define a constructor that only takes an InnerException
without a message.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
60) If you use value types rather than reference types, will this stop the garbage collector from being called?

The garbage collector collects and removes objects from the heap that have no reference. The garbage collector is called when the program runs out of avaiable memory.
If due to the usage of value types your program does not run out of avaiable memory, the garbage collector will not be called.

YES, because you dont run out of avaiable memory.           

Book answer:
Value types are normally stored on the stack (unless the type is part of a
closure – see the Closures section in Skill 1.4, “Create and implement events
and callbacks”). When a program exits from a block the variables on the
stack are automatically removed. This means creating and destroying types
such as integer, float, and double will not make any work for the garbage
collector. However, if the value type is a struct, and the struct contains
reference types, it will create work for the garbage collector, as the objects
inside the structure will need to be managed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
61) Does creating and destroying arrays of value types make work for the garbage collector?

YES
Array types are reference types which are derived from the abstract base type Array. They are therefore allocated on the heap and when destroyed their memory 
needs to be freed by the garbage collector.


Book answer:
Arrays of value types are implemented as objects. For example, an array of
100 integers will be managed as an object that contains 100 integers and an
array reference to that object. This means that such arrays will be
implemented on the heap and their removal from memory will involve the
garbage collector.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
62) Does the garbage collector also collect garbage from the stack?

NO, stack variables of a method are automatically cleared when you leave the method.   

Book answer:
No. The stack grows and contracts as a program runs. It is not managed by
the garbage collector.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
63) Can a finalizer be called before the Dispose method in an object?

Yes, when the dispose method of an object is not called in code, the GC calls the finalizer of unreferenced objects when freeing memory, 
the finalizer in turn calls the dispose(false) method to free unmanaged resources.       

Book answer:
Yes. It is the application developer’s responsibility to make sure that the
Dispose method is called to request that the object release any resources that
it is using, but if this does not happen, and the object is deleted from
memory, the finalize method will be called first. The dispose pattern has
been designed to ensure that an object would release resources in a sensible
way in this situation.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
64) Can the finalizer method in a class be overloaded?

No, GC need a predefined finalizer to call with no arguments   

Book answer:
No. It would not be meaningful for the finalizer method in a class does to
accept any parameters, so overloading the method (providing versions with
different numbers of parameters) is not possible.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
65) Does a finalizer in a child class have to call the finalizer in a base class when it runs?

No, When the finalizer of a child object is called by the GC, the finalizer calls the dispose(bool disposing) method,
the dispose(bool disposing) method calls the base.dispose(bool disposing) of the parent at the end of the method. 
   
Book answer:
No. There is no need for a finalizer in a child class to make any calls to the
finalizer in a parent class. Each class in a class hierarchy can have its own
finalizer and each of them will be called in turn when the object is finalized.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
66) Is it possible for the Dispose method in an instance to be called more than once?

Yes, if programming code decides to call the dispose multiple times it can.
To avoid releasing resources multiple times, a flag is used so that resources are released only once.         

Book answer:
When the Dispose method in an instance is called is down to the application
itself. It may call Dispose multiple times. The dispose pattern uses a flag to
ensure that this does not cause problems.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
67) What happens if an object finalizer takes a long time to run?

The garbage collecting process is the severely constrained because further calls to other object finalizers are stopped.      

Book answer:
A long running finalizer will seriously impact on the performance of the
garbage collection process. In an extreme situation this may result in the
application running out of memory as the garbage collector cannot recover
memory faster than it is being used.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
68) What happens if an object finalizer creates a new reference to the object being finalized?

Nothing happens

Book answer:
It is bad practice for a finalizer to create a new reference to itself. This
results in the object not being deleted from memory. Remember that the
garbage collector makes another pass through the heap after the finalizers
have been called. Any object that has a reference to it will be retained.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
69) Should you design your applications from the start to use the minimum possible memory? 

No, RAM memory is readily available, in addition GC is optimised to release memory of destroyed objects.     

Book answer:
Security should be designed into an application very carefully from the start.
However, in regard to performance and memory use, I advise that you don’t
do much more than avoid obviously stupid solutions that impact on these
factors, and then just focus on creating an application that is easy to
understand and test. If you subsequently discover that you have performance
or memory issues, that is the point that you use your diagnostics tools to
identify resource hungry elements of your program and then optimize those.
A lot of developers (including me) have spent a lot of time making programs
smaller and quicker when there is no need to do this, particularly with
modern hardware.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
70) Can you hold the text of an entire book in a single string instance?

Yes, the max size of a string content is about 2 GB

Book answer:
The novel “War and Peace” by Tolstoy is generally accepted to be a long
book. It contains around half a million words. However, even if each word
was 20 characters long, this would only equate to around ten million
characters. Strings are indexed using a 32-bit integer, which makes the
theoretical limit on string size at around two thousand million characters. So
you can say that all novels will fit into a single string.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
71) A string object is immutable. Does this mean you can’t assign a new value to a string variable once you have set it to a value?

No, It means that when you assign a new value to a string variable, a new string object is created which holds the new value. 
The object with the old value is marked for deletion by GC, has no more references to it.      

Book answer:
The contents of a string object cannot be changed. However; a string
variable can be made to refer to a different string instance. In other words,
don’t change the contents of a string variable called name from “Rob” to
“Robert”. Instead, make the string variable name refer to a new string
instance that contains “Robert.”
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
72) Are there any disadvantages to interning strings in a C# program?

Yes, when creating a new string you have to check all other strings in the application to find out if the new string is unique or not, 
this is time consuming. If string content already exists you can return the reference of that existing string.      

Book answer:
Interning of strings takes place when the compiler notices the same string
literal is assigned to multiple variables in the program source. The compiler
makes a single “interned” variable that contains the string literal and all the
variables assigned that literal are made to refer to this single value. At run
time this has the advantage that the program may be able to compare strings
more quickly because two string variables will be equal if they both refer to
the same interned object. The only disadvantage of interning is that it slows
down the compilation process.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
73) Is the StringBuilder type based on the string type?

NO If StringBuilder is based on the string type you would not have an efficient string manipulation function performance and memory wise, because strings are immutable.
StringBuilder is based on a character array which allows easy concatenation and manipulation of strings.        

Book answer:
The StringBuilder type is not based on string. The StringBuilder
will use one or more arrays of characters to build a string.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
74) Will using StringBuilder always make your programs go faster?

No, performance benefits of StringBuilder are achieved when you are concatenating a lot of strings.     

Book answer:
If a program does a lot of string addition to assemble an output string it may
be that using StringBuilder to assemble the string will improve
performance and perhaps reduce the number of intermediate objects that will be created.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
75) Can you store binary data in a StringWriter?

Yes its possible to store binary data in a char or string which can the be stored in a StringWriter.  

Book answer:
You can’t store binary data in a StringWriter because a
StringWriter implements the TextWriter interface, which can only
accept strings of text.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
76) Does the Trim method change the contents of a string?

The Trim method remove spaces at the beginning en end of a string and returns a new object free of leading and trailing spaces. 

Book answer:
The Trim method is used to remove whitespace from an input string and
return a new string with the whitespace removed. It does not change the
contents of a string value because strings are immutable.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
77) What does it mean if an object implements the IFormattable interface?

It means that an object implements a ToString(string format,IFormatProvider), it formats the the content of an object using the format specifier and taking into
account the passed culture (If the object implements culture specific formatting)     

Book answer:
An object that implements the iFormattable interface contains a
ToString method that accepts a format string and a format provider that
can be used to provide culture specific information about the culture for
which the string is being formatted. Objects that implement
iFormattable can be used with formatted output which contains
formatting instructions that are given the ToString methods.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
78) What does a CultureInfo object actually contain?

The CultureInfo class provides culture-specific information, such as the language, sublanguage, country/region, calendar, and conventions associated with a particular culture. This class also provides access to culture-specific instances of the DateTimeFormatInfo, NumberFormatInfo, CompareInfo, and TextInfo objects. These objects contain the information required for culture-specific operations, such as casing, formatting dates and numbers, and comparing strings. The CultureInfo class is used either directly or indirectly by classes that format, parse, or manipulate culture-specific data, such as String, DateTime, DateTimeOffset, and the numeric types.

Book answer:
A CultureInfo instance contains information describing the formatting
of output for use by a particular culture. The CultureInfo instance
contains references to the NumberFormatInfo and
DateTimeFormatInfo objects for the culture. These specify such things
as the ordering of dates when printed, the character to be used to mean
currency and the separators between digits in large numbers. A formatter can
use those parts of a CultureInfo instances as it needs to produce output
that reflects different regions of the world.

79) Can you use string interpolation with strings of text that are created as the program runs?

No, strings that use string interpolation are converted by the compiler as normal string formats and then used.    

Book answer:
String interpolation takes place when the compiler works on literal string
values in the program source. A string that is identified as an interpolated
string by having a dollar character ($) added before the start of the string
will be parsed and the names of variables to be printed extracted. This all
happens at compile time, so it is not possible to use interpolation on strings
that are generated when the program runs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
80) How can using value types when possible improve your performance? Or could it be that your performance will deteriorate more?

The use of value types could deteriorate performance, imagine if we have a big struct containing a lot of value types and we pass the 
struct by value to a method, the struct is then copied and passed to the method which is CPU intensive.
If you pass an object (Reference type) to a method, only the memory adres of the object is passed to the method which is very efficient in terms
of CPU usage and memory usage. One advantage of using value types is that the variables are allocated on the stack, once you leave a method all
the stack variables are removed, the GC does not have to release memory when using value types on the stack.            

Book answer:
Reference types are on the heap and managed by the garbage collector. Value types
are on the stack most of the time and are freed when the current method ends. When
a value type is on the stack, it takes up less memory than it would on the heap. However,
if a value type is enclosed in a reference type, it’s still on the heap. Changing the
type to a struct is no guarantee that your memory pressure will drop.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
81) Why is implementing IDisposable important to reduce memory pressure? Is it always the best to call Dispose on an element as soon as you are done with it?

Implementing IDisposable makes sure that you release managed and unmanaged resources in a controlled way, thereby reducing memory pressure,
because released managed resources are ready to be collected by the GC. 
If you dont need an object any longer, you can call Dispose on an element as soon as you are done with it.

Book answer:
IDisposable gives you a way to explicitly free up unmanaged resources and you won’t
have to wait for the garbage collector to free memory. However, calling Dispose is
something that takes up CPU time. When leaving things to the garbage collector, the
garbage collector will decide when is the best time to start calling finalizers. There is a
compromise to make between explicitly or implicitly freeing your resources.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
82) Should you implement a finalizer on all your types that implement IDisposable?

You should only implement a finalizer on types that have unmanaged resources that cannot be freed by the GC.

Book answer:
A class that implements IDisposable should have some unmanaged resources. A finalizer
is important for making sure that an item always frees the unmanaged resources,
even when Dispose is not called. However, a class with a finalizer is threaded in a
special way. The object is added to a finalization queue and is kept in memory until the
finalizer has run. It’s important to make sure that when Dispose is called, the object is
explicitly removed from the finalization queue.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
83) You have some items that are used a lot. Would it be wise to put them in a static field so you don’t have to re-create them each time?

It depends, if each instance has its own item than you cannot use a static field, but if all instances have the same item you can use a static field.    
Another solution would be to cache the items that are used a lot, in this way you dont have to recreate the items.   

Book answer:
A static field is a root reference; the garbage collector will never free an object that is
referenced by a static field. In this case, it would be better to use a cache that keeps
track of which objects should be kept in memory. A caching algorithm that decides
on how frequently an object is accessed can make sure that your objects are around.
However, when there is a memory shortage, the cache can turn some objects into
WeakReferences and make sure they can be garbage collected.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
84)You are about to execute a piece of code that is performance-sensitive. You are afraid that a garbage collection will occur during the execution of this code. Which method should you call before executing your code?

A. GC.RemoveMemoryPressure()
B. GC.SuppressFinalize()
C. GC.Collect()
D. GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers()

C, Start GC 

Book answer:

Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: RemoveMemoryPressure should be called only after calling AddMemoryPressure
to inform the runtime that a managed object uses a large amount of
unmanaged memory.
B. Incorrect: SuppressFinalize should be called in the Dispose method of an object to
inform the runtime that the object doesn’t need to be finalized any more.
C. Correct: Collect will execute a garbage collection, freeing as much memory as
possible at that time, which can be a very expensive process. This won’t prevent
the garbage collector from executing during your time-sensitive code, but it will
make it less likely to happen.
D. Incorrect: WaitForPendingFinalizers suspends the current thread so all finalizers
that are on the finalization queue can run. This will free some memory (for all
objects that are waiting for finalization). Normally, however, you call this code after
calling Collect if you want to make sure that all finalizers have run.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
85) An object that is implementing IDisposable is passed to your class as an argument. Should you wrap the element in a using statement?

A. Yes, otherwise a memory leak could happen.
B. No, you should call Close on the object.
C. No, you should use a try/finally statement and call Dispose yourself.
D. No, the calling method should use a using statement.

D The method that created the object that is implementing IDisposable should also dispose it. 

Book answer:

Correct answer: D
A. Incorrect: A memory leak won’t happen because the finalizer of the class will
eventually execute and dispose of the element. Disposing of the object in your
method will cause an ObjectDisposedException to be thrown in other code that
uses the object.
B. Incorrect: The Close method is sometimes used as a secondary method that
internally calls Dispose. It’s implemented on types such as File. The same reasoning
applies as with answer A.
C. Incorrect: A using statement is equivalent to a try/finally statement with a Dispose
call. However, you don’t want to dispose of the item because the calling code
could depend on the object being in a usable state.
D. Correct: The calling code knows what the lifetime of the object should be and
should decide when to dispose of the object.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
86) Your application is using a lot of memory. Which solution should you use?

A. Turn all references into WeakReferences.
B. Set all references to null when you are done with them.
C. Use a caching algorithm to decide which objects can be freed.
D. Use a background thread to call GC.Collect() on a scheduled interval.

C) Objects that are often used need to be cached other need to be freed (dispose and GC collected)    

Book answer:

Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: A WeakReference is not an equivalent to an efficient caching strategy.
Turning all items into WeakReferences will complicate your code (you have to see
whether the memory is cleared). It could potentially increase your memory usage
because the WeakReference itself also takes up memory.
B. Incorrect: Setting references to null is optimized away by the compiler. Unlike
some other languages, it doesn’t explicitly free any memory.
C. Correct: A caching strategy is the best solution. You can decide whether you want
to free memory based on usage, a timestamp, or some other criteria.
D. Incorrect: Calling GC.Collect on a scheduled interval won’t improve your memory
usage. Memory is freed only when there are no root references to an object.
GC.Collect will stall your execution thread, making things slower, while not freeing
any more memory than waiting for a regular Collect to take place.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
87) Make a list of the things you have to keep in mind when updating your applica-tion for globalization.

Currencies, DateTime formats should be checked, in addition string comparison when searching a database for example.
Furthermore application layout and colors used could be subject to localization, for example arab countries write in opposite direction as western.
Color pallet usage can be subject to localization.      


Book answer:
This is not a trivial task to do. Building globalization into an existing application requires more
effort than taking it into account from the start.
The areas you will have to focus on are the display of text. Especially because this is a time
tracking application there will be a lot of dates and times that are displayed.
There are a few areas you will have to focus on:
* Make sure that all string comparisons use an explicit overload that takes a StringComparison object.
* Use StringComparison.Ordinal or StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase when comparing
strings in a culture-agnostic way.
* Use StringComparison.CurrentCulture when displaying text to the user.
* Make sure that all persisted text is persisted with the invariant culture.
* Make sure that you are not using String.Compare or CompareTo for equality testing.
* Implement IFormattable for custom types that are displayed to the user to make sure
that all culture settings are respected.
* Use the correct format strings when displaying numbers, dates, and times to the user.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
88) You want to display only the date portion of a DateTime according to the French culture. What method should you use?

A. dt.ToString(new CultureInfo(“fr-FR”))
B. dt.ToString(“M”, new CultureInfo(“fr-FR”));
C. dt.ToString(“d”);
D. dt.ToString(“d”, new CultureInfo(“fr-FR”));

D) You specify the format (the date portion of a DateTime) and you specify the CultureInfo which implements IFormatProvider (retrieve the DateTime format for French culture)

Book answer:
Correct answer: D
A. Incorrect: Only specifying the culture will give you the full date and time.
B. Incorrect: Specifying “M” as the format string results in ”22 avril” without the year.
C. Incorrect: This will give the date in the correct format, but not with the French culture.
D. Correct: This will give the date in the correct French format.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
89) You want your type to be able to be converted from string. Which interface should you implement?

A. IFormattable
B. IFormatProvider
C. IComparable
D. IConvertible

A) The interface defines a method ToString(string format, IFormatProvider culture) which you need to implement. 

Book answer:
Correct answer: A
A. Correct: IFormattable provides the functionality to format the value of an object
into a string representation. It is also used by the Convert class to do the opposite.
B. Incorrect: IFormatProvider is used to retrieve an object that controls formatting,
not the actual formatting.
C. Incorrect: IComparable is used to sort items.
D. Incorrect: IConvertible defines methods to convert a type to an equivalent CLR
type.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
90) You are parsing a large piece of text to replace values based on some complex algorithm. Which class should you use?

A. StringReader
B. StringBuilder
C. StringWriter
D. String

B) StringBuilder is very flexible in replacing pieces of text.  

Book answer:
Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: StringReader is an adapter of the StringBuilder class so that it can be
used in places where a TextReader is required.
B. Correct: The StringBuilder class is most efficient when changing large amounts of
strings.
C. Incorrect: The StringWriter is used in places where a TextWriter is required. It’s an
adapter of the StringBuilder.
D. Incorrect: The regular String class is immutable, so it’s not efficient to use when
changing large amounts of strings.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
91) You want to store information about the employees that work in my
company. Is this a job for a value type or a reference type?

Employee is a reference type, it has an identity.

Book answer:
Essentially this boils down to the question of whether you want to store your
employee records in a structure (value type) or a class (reference type). If
you want to handle different types of employee such as part time, shift
worker, and manager then you might find that a class hierarchy is useful, in
which case a reference type is needed, because structures cannot be used as
the basis of class hierarchies. Using reference types will make it much easier
to index and sort your employee records. For example, you can have two
employee lists, one ordered by employee name and another ordered by pay
grade. Each list will contain references to employee objects. Structures are
best suited to small value types, which you may want to make immutable.
You might create a data type that holds the record of when an employee
started with the company. This could contain their age at starting, the day
they started and other information. This could be held in a structure as it is a
small amount of data that you just want to store somewhere. It might also be
worth making this item of data immutable, since there is no need to edit the
information once it has been created. Using a structure (value type) to hold
the data would be a good idea if the number of data items is very large.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
92) Can an object be referred to by more than one reference?

Yes, for example two employee objects could reference the same manager object, the manager object is then referred by two employee objects.     

Book answer:
Yes, a single object can have multiple references referring to it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
93) What happens when an object no longer has any references to it?

An object that no longer has any references to it is a candidate for GC collection to free its memory when the GC is started.  

Book answer:
It might be that as a program runs, and references are assigned different
values, then an object in memory no longer has any references to it from the
program. At this point the object can be destroyed, since it can never be used
again. The C# runtime environment contains a “garbage collection” process
that checks for objects that have no references to them. These objects are
removed when they are detected.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
94)If you use a value type rather than a reference type, will your program still work correctly?

It depends on the application, if you want to have objects that refer to other objects, this is a problem if you only have value types.     
For example if you have multiple Employee objects refer to one Manager Object, if using value type this would mean that each employee has
its own copy of the manager object.  

Book answer:
It is possible to create any program entirely using reference types or value
types. The behavior of assignments and the effects of changes to objects
means that if your program treats a value type as a reference type (or vice
versa), you will discover that it will not behave as you might expect.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
95) How can you make a data type immutable?

By setting its members via the constructor when the object is created, the members dont have any public setters.     

Book answer:
A data type can be made immutable by providing no means of changing the
variables held inside the type. The values of the data type should be set by
the constructor and the type should only provide methods and properties that
can be used to read these variables. The variables in the type must all be
made private to the type.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
96) Are value types more efficient that reference types?

No, when you pass a reference type to a method only the heap memory adddress is passed to the method. When passing a value type to a method, 
for example large struct, the struct members are copied and this uses a lot of CPU processing and memory. 
Note stack memory is cleared after a method call.   

Book answer:
Value types can be regarded as slightly more efficient to access than
reference types. To access a reference type a program must follow the
reference to the position in the heap where the object is stored. A value type
can be accessed directly and an array of value types is stored in a single
block of storage that contains all of the values. The performance difference
will not be noticeable except in extreme circumstances where huge numbers
of objects are being processed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
97) What is the difference between the stack and the heap?

Stack memory is cleared after method call. Heap memory is allocated and freed by the GC. 

Book answer:
Space on the stack is allocated as a program runs. Each time a block is
entered, an area of stack space is reserved for value type variables that are
created when the method runs. When the block exits, all of the stack space is
recovered and the value type variables deleted. Space on the heap is
allocated when reference types are created. A reference type may have a
lifetime that is longer than the block in which it is declared. For example, a
method that creates a new Employee record that is a reference type will
return the reference. If the Employee is created on the stack it will disappear
when the method finishes. The heap has no particular structure, so there is
no guarantee that successively created objects will be in adjacent locations
on the heap. Given that C# programs run in a managed environment, they
are not able to determine the precise position of objects in memory.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
98) Do you need to add a constructor method for every object that you create?

No, only if you want to initialize the object with a certain value. A default constructor is provided by c# framework.
You can create an object with a default constructor and after creation you can set its members.   
A constructor is a method which gets control during the process of object
creation. It is used to allow initial values to be set into an object.
        
Book answer:
Most types will require at least one constructor, so that your application can
ensure that the object has a valid initial state and can feed information into
the type via the constructor to set it up. The construction of the objects in
your system is something that should be planned at the time the system is
designed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
99) Is there ever any point in creating objects that cannot be constructed?

Yes creating objects using a factory. The constructor is then made private.  

Book answer:
A class that only contains static members does not need to be constructed.
You find static classes like this that contain service methods.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
100) What does it mean when a member of a type is made static?

It means that all objects/instances share the same static member.    

Book answer:
A static member of a type exists as part of the type, not a given instance of
the type. It is accessed via the name of the class. Static members are great
for storing things like limits (largest and smallest) and default values
(default age for a customer) as these only need to be stored for an entire
class, not for each object.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
101) Should you provide default values for all of the parameters to a method?

No, you should only use default values for parameters that often use the same value (You can then make this often used value the default).  

Book answer:
A program can provide default values for method parameters. This can be
useful, because it can simplify the use of the methods. It also, however,
provides a form of information hiding, in that users of the method may not
know what the default values are. I restrict default values to parameters that
specify “optional” rather than “core” behaviors.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
101) Does using a lot of overridden methods slow a program down?

No

Book answer:
A method that is marked as virtual can be overridden in a class hierarchy.
When an overridden method is called on a reference the runtime system
must search up the class hierarchy for the version of the method to use. The
deeper the class hierarchy the longer it will take for this search to find the
method. This means that extensive use of overridden methods in a class
hierarchy may have an impact on program performance, but it is unlikely to
be noticeable unless the class hierarchy is very deep. I usually try to avoid a
hierarchy more than five or so levels deep, but this is as much in respect of
organizational complexity as it is program performance.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
102) If every variable in a program was managed by reference, would you ever
need to box a value?

No, Boxing is used to convert value types to reference types, unboxing converts reference types to value types. 
Boxing/Unboxing slows programs down.

int val = 2020;
object obj = 2020; //Boxing
val = (int)obj; //Unboxing 


Book answer:
Boxing is the name given to the action of converting a value type (which is
most likely stored on a local stack) into a reference type (which will be
stored on the heap). It is performed when we need to work with a value as an
object, perhaps to allow the value to be inserted in a data structure that is
managed by reference. Some programming languages have no value types at
all and manage everything by reference. This simplifies some aspects of the
way that programs will execute, but it does this at the expense of
performance. A program will spend a lot of its time just manipulating
values, and the use of reference types will significantly slow down this
process. You could write a C# program that uses nothing but the interface
types that provide the object implementations of value types, but this would
run a lot more slowly than one that used value types.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
103) Do you need to use a cast when your program is widening a type?

Casting is only needed when narrowing a type, which means data is lost.
int val = 2020;
double val2 = val; //Widening no casting needed
val = (int)val2;	//Narrowing cast needed because data is lost.


Book answer:
Widening is the situation when a value is being moved from one type to
another with a wide range of possible values, for example from int to
double. In this situation there is no possibility of data being lost, and so
casting is not required. However, you can add it for clarity if you wish.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
104) Does casting between values slow a program down?

Casting isn't very expensive in terms of performance. Of course, if you have a loop that runs a million times a second it might make sense 
to avoid casting to save some performance, otherwise it won't really cause performance issues.

Book answer:
Casting between value types may be something that the Central Processor
Unit (cpu) of the computer can perform very quickly. However, if the
casting process involves calling a type conversion method this will take
longer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
105)Can an object have multiple type conversion methods?

Yes

Book answer:
A type conversion method is added to an object to generate a value to be
used when an object is cast into a particular type. Each type conversion
method is assigned a “target” type, and so it would be possible for an object
to have a type conversion that produces an integer result and another that
produces a floating-point result. However, I would suggest that in these
situations it may be clearer to make use of properties to return a value from a
type, rather than using casting and type conversion methods, which are not
something that all programmers will have come across.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
106) Could you write a program that used entirely dynamic types?

Yes, the main disadvantage of using dynamic types is that the compiler cannot validate/check the type interaction.   

Book answer:
You can write a program that uses entirely dynamic types. It should always
compile, since the compiler will not perform any static error checking.
However, it would probably fail quite frequently too, as mistakes that would
normally produce compilation errors would not be spotted and would
manifest themselves as run time errors. Using dynamic types also makes
development more difficult in another way. Dynamic types acquire their
types at runtime and so the Intellisense feature of Visual Studio cannot
provide any useful information about a variable of dynamic type as it
doesn’t know what that type of information the variable is holding.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
107)Why do you need to interact with Component Object Model (COM) objects?

There are component written in other unmanaged languages, if you want to interact with these components you can do this using
Component Object Model, an example is interaction with Excel from c#, using PIA (Primary Interop Assembly).      

Book answer:
Many applications, for example the Microsoft Office Suite, provide
automation features that are accessed via COM interfaces. This is also true
of some of the lower level elements of the Windows operating system. It is
unlikely that you will have to interact with lots of COM objects during your
programming career, but it is important to be able to work with them, and
the dynamic type removes a lot of effort from this.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
108) Is it better to use a property rather than get and set methods for private data
members in your classes?

Yes, you can better use one property with a getter and setter then using two methods to set and get property value.  
A property makes it easier to have overview of program instead of two methods working on the same data member.

private string Name { get; set; } 

instead of  
 
private string GetName() {}
private string SetName(string name) {}
 
 
Book answer:
There are two ways that an object can encapsulate data values. It can
provide properties, or it can provide getter and setter methods (sometimes
called accessors and mutators respectively). Properties are very easy to use
from the point of view of code that has to interact with the encapsulated
values, they be assigned and read in the same way as public data values.
From a performance perspective there is no difference between properties
and get/set methods. We have seen that the compiler actually generates get
and set methods when properties are compiled. However, get and set
methods are slightly more flexible, in that a set method can perform
validation on an input value and return a result that indicates whether an
input value has been set correctly. The set behavior of a property could also
perform validation, but the set behavior cannot return a status value.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
109) Can structures contain private data members and properties?

Yes.


Book answer:
There is no reason why a structure should not contain private members and
properties. Although most people consider encapsulation as something that
is performed on classes, structures can be encapsulated objects. An extreme
form of encapsulation is the creation of immutable objects. These contain
data that is set when they are created and cannot be modified. An immutable
object will provide read-only properties and accessor methods to allow other
programs to view the contents of the object.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
110) Does using properties slow down the execution of my program?

No

Book answer:
Using properties will slightly slow down a program, in that a property
behavior will take longer to complete than just getting a value directly from
an object. However, the property access code will be inlined in that rather
than calling a function to perform the property behavior the compiler will
just output the code required. This makes a program slightly larger (there
may be multiple copies of the code that uses the property) but it also means
that accessing properties in objects is almost as fast as accessing the values
directly.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
111) Which provides a greater amount of access to a class member, protected or internal?

It depends, within the same assemby internal provides the greatest amount of access to a class member.
However if you want to access a class member from another assembly protected provides the greatest amount of access to a class member.
Because internal classes are not accessible outside the assembly in which they reside.         

Book answer:
A member of a class with the access modifier protected is visible in that
class and in any classes that are children of that class. A member of a class
with the access modifier internal is visible to any class that is declared in the
same assembly. This means that an internal item has the potential to be seen
by more classes in an application.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
112)Are there any reasons not to use explicit implementation of methods in an object?

If you want to make a method virtual so that it can be overriden in a child/derived class.   

Book answer:
The only reason that an object would not use an explicit implementation of
interface methods is if the programmer wants to “share” some methods
between several interfaces. This is not the kind of thing that sensible
programmers should do.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
113) Should you design your interfaces after you have designed your application?

No, You should design your interfaces during application design, a interface describes the capabilities of a class.
During application design, you should describes your classes in terms of capabilities (Interfaces).       

Book answer:
The behaviors that are required by an object are best expressed in the form
of an interface. You might create a proof of concept application and then
create interfaces based on the behaviors of the objects in that application, but
you should make sure that the interfaces are established right at the start of
the development process.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
114)Can a C# interface contain anything other than method signatures?

Yes, a C# interface can also contain properties, and events. 

Book answer:
A C# interface can also contain the definition of properties that should be
created any class that implements the interface.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
115)Can a C# interface be extended?

Yes, by extending a C# interface any object which implements a interface would also have to implement the inherited interfaces.

Book answer:
Yes. A C# interface can be extended. We actually did this when we extended
the IComparable interface.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
116) Are all the methods defined in an interface public?

Yes, a interface describes the (public) capabilities of a class for other classes, hence all the methods defined in an interface are public.

Book answer:
Yes. All the methods in a C# interface must be made public. However, an
interface can be made internal, which means that it is only visible within a
given assembly.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
117) Does a class have to implement all the methods in an interface that it implements?

Yes, a class has to implement all the methods defined in interface, it has to fulfil the capabilities that it describes.  
Note that interfaces do not describe how the methods are implemented, it only describes the method signature.    

Book answer:
No. A class must contain implementations of all the methods in an interface
if we want to create instances of that class. A class in a class hierarchy could
implement some methods in an interface and a child method of the class
could implement the rest. In this situation it would not be possible to create
an instance of the base class as this does not contain implementations of all
the interfaces. Note that this design approach is not something I would
encourage.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
118) Can a C# interface contain a constructor method?

No, it would not make sense that a interface contain a constructor method, because you cannot create a instance of the interface and
it would not make sense to define a constructor template in the interface because each constructor in a class has its own name (same as class name).    
     
Book answer:
No. Interfaces do not contain constructors. If you want to go down the route
of having interface methods that construct instances you will have to put
factory methods (methods which return references to instances that they
have created) in the interface.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
119) Is it sensible for an object to implement more than one interface?

In my opinion a class should have high cohesion which means it should have one responsibility, do one thing.
This means a class should implement one interface. But there could be classes that need to implement multiple interfaces.
For example a report object could implement a IPrintable (to print report) and an IFormatter (to format the report).   
        
Book answer:
It can be. For example an Employee record that must be printed could
expose an IEmployee interface and an IPrintable interface.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
120) Can only the base class of a hierarchy implement an interface?

No, child/derived classes can also implement their own interfaces. 

Book answer:
No. Interfaces can be implemented at any level of a class hierarchy. If the
base class implements the interface, this has the effect of forcing any
children of the base class to implement the interfaces too, but child classes
can implement further interfaces. However, this is not something that I
would encourage.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
121)Does making methods virtual slow a program down?

No, 

Book answer:
Yes. Very slightly. A non-virtual method can be called directly, since there
will only ever be one copy of that method. When a virtual method is called
the .NET runtime must search for the most appropriate method to call,
starting with the type of the object and then looking up the class hierarchy to
find the method in base classes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
122) Does making methods virtual reduce the security of a program?

Yes, it could reduce the security of a program because virtual methods can be overriden in derived classes (with their own implementation) 

Book answer:
Yes. A method that is virtual can be overridden and replaced with one that
has a different behavior in the child. You should only do this for methods for
which you have a definite need for the ability to override their behavior.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
123) What is the difference between a C# interface and an abstract C# class?

The main difference is that abstract C# class can have fully implemented methods, interfaces only have method signatures.  
Furthermore abstract C# class can have  constructors, although they cannot be instantiated.
 
public abstract class A{

    private string data;

    protected A(string myString){
      data = myString;
    }
	
	//Fully implemented method. 
	public void Print()
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Print() method at work." + data);
	}
}

public class B : A {

     B(string myString) : base(myString){}

}

Book answer:

An interface specifies a set of behaviors that an object must provide so that
it can be referred to by a reference of the interface type. This provides a
great deal of flexibility, for example a list of interface references could
contain any type of object, as long as that type implemented the interface.
By contrast, an abstract type is more restrictive. It contains a set of behaviors
that an object must provide, but the object can only then be regarded in
terms of the abstract type, not in any other way.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
124) Should every class that you create be part of a class hierarchy (either as a
base class or a child class)?

No, you create class hierarchies when you want to reuse existing code/behaviours. 

Book answer:
No. If there is no need for an object to be extended then it does not need to
be part of a hierarchy.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
125)Can a method be both overridden and overloaded?

Yes, see example below

public class BaseClass
{
	public virtual Print() 
	{
		//Implementation
	}

	//Print overloaded
	public virtual Print(int height, int width) 
	{
		//Implementation
	}
}

public class ChildClass : BaseClass
{
	//BaseClass Methods that are overriden in the derived class
	public override Print() 
	{
		//Implementation
	}

	//Print overloaded
	public override Print(int height, int width) 
	{
		//Implementation
	}
}

Book answer:
Yes it can. However, if a method is going to be overridden (replaced in a
child class) then I would be wary of providing too many overloaded forms
of the method in the base class, as the child class will have to provide
overriding implementations of all the overloaded versions, otherwise the
behavior of the child objects may not be correct.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
126) Can you override a method in a structure type?

No, you can implement interfaces in a struct but you cannot use inheritance    

Book answer:
No. Structures are value types and cannot be used in class hierarchies.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
127) Can a structure implement an interface?

Yes

Book answer:
Yes. Although structures cannot be used in class hierarchies they can be
declared as implementing interfaces. A structure value will be boxed (turned
from a value to a reference type) if it is to be
accessed via an interface reference, but this will happen automatically.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
128) What does it mean when a class is sealed?

A sealed class cannot be derived from.

Book answer:
A class that has been sealed cannot be used as the base of a child class that
extends it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
129) Can any object implement the IEnumerable interface?

Yes, you need to implement the GetEnumerator method.  

Book answer:
Yes. Any object can implement IEnumerable. However, it is only
meaning for items that contain or deal with enumerable collections to
implement this interface.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
130) Does the yield keyword cause my program to stop?

No, it returns control to the calling method.

Book answer:
No. It causes an enumerator to return the value specified by the yield return.
When the next enumeration is requested from the enumerator the
enumerator will continue from the statement following the yield.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
131) Does calling the Dispose method on an object remove it from memory?

No, calling the Dispose method releases managed and unmanaged resources after which the object is ready to be removed from memory by the GC 
(The GC starts to remove unreferenced objects when the available memory drops below a treshold)     

Book answer:
No. The object will still exist in memory after it has been disposed.
However, any attempt to use the object will result in an exception being
thrown.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
132) If you use IDispose do you have to call the Dispose method myself to
dispose of objects.

Yes, you can call the dispose method to release managed and unmanged resources (after which the memory can be released by the GC at a certain time).
If the object implements a finalizer that calls the dispose(false) method, the GC can call the Finalizer which then disposes any unmanaged resource,
so in that way you dont have to call it yourself.      

Book answer:
Yes. The C# system will not call Dispose automatically. However, if you
use the using construction this will call Dispose for you.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
133) If you use the IDispose interface to tidy up your objects, does this mean that
they will be deleted more quickly by the garbage collector?

No, the major advantage of implementing the IDispose interface is that you can release unmanaged resources which could not be released by the GC.   
Objects that do not have references from the program will be scheduled for GC removal at a certain time 
(When avaiable application memory drops below a certain treshold)

Book answer:
Not necessarily. The use of using means that the system can be absolutely
clear when an object is no longer required, but this will not invoke a garbage
collection action to remove that object.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
134) Where are the values of attributes actually stored?

Attributes are stored in the metadata of the class, the class definition itself. Any values changed to attribute objects are not persisted.  

//Decorated with attributes 
[ProgrammerAtribute(name:"MyName")]
public class MyClass
{
}

Book answer:
The values of attributes are stored in the assembly file that is created when a
program is compiled.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
135) What happens if you change the value of a member of an attribute when the
program is running?

The value of a member of an attribute is changed but the changed value is not persisted when the application is restarted for example.

Book answer:
When a class is loaded the attribute class instances are created and the
values in them are initialized. A program can change a value in an attribute,
but this will not be persisted when the program ends. This is because
programs are not allowed to change the contents of the assembly files from
which they are loaded.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
136) Can an attribute class have attributes?

Yes, for example you can add the AttributeUseage  to the attribute class specifying that you for example can only decorate a class with the attribute and not methods.  

Book answer:
Yes it can, in fact the AttributeUseage class is an example of an
attribute that is applied to attributes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
137) Where is the type information for a class stored?

In the metadata of the class, the class definition.

Book answer:
The type information for a class is stored in the assembly file where the code
for that class is stored.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
138) What is the difference between typeof and GetType?

GetType() retrieves the type of an object/instance. typeof() works on a class definition/type 

Book answer:
You can use GetType to get the type of any object in your program.
GetType is provided by all objects. The typeof method is used to get the
type object that represents a particular type. It is used if you don’t have (or
need) an instance of the object but you want to use the type data in your
program.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
139) Can the GetType method be called on value types?

Yes, the parent class of value types implements the GetType method.      
Both reference and value types are derived from the ultimate base class Object. ValueType overrides the virtual methods from Object with more appropriate implementations for value types. ValueType Class Provides the base class for value types.  

Book answer:
The GetType method will return the reference to the type of any object;
whether the object contents are managed by value or reference. You can
even call GetType on a literal value in a program, in which case the value
will be boxed (converted to a reference type) before the GetType runs.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
140) Can you change the contents of a type description returned by GetType?

No, I assume the type object that contains information about a type is immutable, since it would not make sense to modify readonly info about a type.      

Book answer:
No. You can create brand new types by using CodeDOM or expression trees,
but you can’t modify the behavior of a class by changing elements in its type
description. This would be very dangerous if it was possible.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
141) Can you use reflection to obtain details of private items in objects?

Yes

Book answer:
Yes. The GetProperty method provided by a Type object can be given
Binding flags that specify NonPublic items. But you really shouldn’t
do this.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
142) Does code created by using a CodeDOM run slower than “normally” written
code?

The code generated using a CodeDOM is the same as normally written, so there is no reason to assume that it will run slower
than normal written code.    

Book answer:
There is no difference between the speed of code produced “normally” and
that produced by a provider that parses a CodeDOM document and
generates a program that way.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
143) Is it possible to read code details from an assembly file?

Yes you can iterate all types present in an assembly file, for each type you can read the methods and implementation.

Book answer:
Yes. A programmer given the assemblies for an application could extract all
the class names and member names from the assembly. They can also view
the actual code of the methods and there are even tools that will reconstruct
a C# source file from an .exe or .dll file. If you are planning to release your
code into the wild you should investigate technology which “obfuscates”
your assembly files, changing the names of items and adding extra code that
makes it much harder to understand what your program does.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
144) Can you use CodeDOM to create a class that implements a particular
interface?

Yes

Book answer:
Yes you could. This would be an interesting application of reflection
(looking at code to find out what it does) and code generation. A program
can add elements to a class being built in CodeDOM document that match
those that it has discovered when parsing an interface. Visual Studio does
something similar to this when you use the built in support that implements
an interface for you in the code editor.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
145) Can you use reflection on the compiled output of a CodeDOM object?

Yes, compiler generated assemblies using CodeDOM are the same as normal written code/assemblies,
therefore you can use reflection to investigate the compiled output of a CodeDOM object.  

Book answer:
Yes you can. The compiled output of a CodeDOM object is an assembly like
any other and will contain all the metadata.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
146) You are creating a new collection type and you want to make sure the elements in it
can be easily accessed. What should you add to the type?
A. Constructor
B. Indexer property
C. Generic type parameter
D. Static property

B Indexer property allows you to access collection items using brackets (item = object[0])  

Book answer:
Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: A constructor is used to create an instance of a new type.
B. Correct: An indexer property enables the user of the type to easily access a type
that represents an array-like collection.
C. Incorrect: Making the type generic enables you to store multiple different types
inside your collection.
D. Incorrect: A static property cannot access the instance data of the collection.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
147)You are creating a generic class that should work only with reference types. Which
type constraint should you add?

A. where T : class
B. where T : struct //A specifies that type T should be value type.
C. where T : new() //A specifies that type T should be reference type with a public parameterless constructor.
D. where T : IDisposable //Specifies that type T is IDisposable interface or implements the IDisposable interface.   

A specifies that type T should be reference type.  

Book answer:
Correct answer: A
A. Correct: Constraining your generic type parameter to class allows the class to be
used only with a reference type.
B. Incorrect: This will constrain the class to be used with a value type, not a reference
type.
C. Incorrect: This will constrain the class to be used with a type that has an empty
default constructor. It can be both a value and a reference type.
D. Incorrect: This constrains the class to be used with a type that implements the
IDisposable interface.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
148)You pass a struct variable into a method as an argument. The method changes the
variable; however, when the method returns, the variable has not changed. What
happened?

A. The variable was not initialized before it was passed in.
B. A value type cannot be changed inside a method.
C. Passing a value type makes a copy of the data. The original wasn’t changed.
D. The method didn’t return the changes.

C

Book answer:
Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: Passing a noninitialized struct will result in a compile error of using an
unassigned local variable.
B. Incorrect: A struct can be changed inside a method. It won’t change the original
struct that was passed in, however.
C. Correct: Passing a struct will make a copy of the data. The copy can be changed;
the original won’t change with it.
D. Incorrect: With a reference type, the method can make changes that will reflect
on the original. Because a value type is copied, it won’t change the original.
Returning the changes from the method will again create a new instance that will
overwrite the original.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
149) You are tasked with creating the basic types for a new web shop. As a customer, you
can search through the existing product database and compare different items by
reviewing specifications and reviews from other users. The system should keep track
of popular products and make recommendations to the customer. Of course, the
customer can then select the products he wants and place an order. There are also
some business rules that you need to be aware of. A new customer is not allowed
to place an order that exceeds $500. An order should be at least $10 to qualify for
free shipping. More business rules will be added, but are not clear at the moment.
Answer the following questions for your manager:

1. Which basic types are you going to use to build your web shop?
	
	I am going to use the following Reference types: 
	Customer object (reference)
	Product object (reference)
	Review object (reference)
	Order Lines object for each product (reference)
	Order object (is the aggregation of Order Lines (reference)) 

2. How can you make sure that your types contain both behavior and data?
	By implementing methods that validate business rules, this is the behavior of classes.
	Bussiness classes can contain datafields and properties containing useful data.  		

3. How can you improve the usability of your types?
	By using interfaces describing the capabilities and classes that implement these interfaces.  

Book answer:
1) Some of the types that you can use in building your web shop are: Order, OrderLine,
Product, Customer, Review, SearchCriteria, BusinessRule.

2)When designing the system, you should focus on the behavior and then make sure
that you have the data to support it. For example, instead of publicly exposing the
OrderLines that an order contains, you should expose a method AddProduct(product,
amount) that creates an OrderLine internally and makes sure that the Order follows all
business rules.

3)By making sure that you have the correct constructors, users of your types can easily
see which data is required. By using enums (for example for the Order status and Customer
status), you can improve readability of your code. By using a base class for your
business rules you can make the system more extensible so that other business rules
can be easily defined.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
150) You are developing a reusable library for doing complex calculations. Your application
is gaining popularity, but you are starting to hear some negative responses.
Some say that your types cannot be used easily. When displaying the end results of
calculations to the end user, there is a lot of manual work involved. Others experience
performance problems and want you to do something about it. You started
developing your application with C# 1.0, and your application uses ArrayLists to
keep track of all the parameters needed for the calculations. Your parameters are
implemented as a struct. Your algorithms are implemented in a class hierarchy, and
you often need to cast a base type to a derived type. Because this isn’t always possible,
you have added a lot of try/catch statements to recover from errors. Answer
the following questions:

1. How can a generic collection improve performance?
	If you use a generic collection, the collection is typed checked on compile time.
	Furthermore you dont need to cast from the object type to a more specific type.      	

2. Is there anything you can do to avoid the exceptions when converting between types?
	You can use methods that dont throw an exception when the conversion fails,
	for example int.TryParse(), returns false when unable to convert between types.  	

3. How can you ensure your type is better converted to the basic CLR types?
	You can provide the custom types with an implicit/explicit converter to basic CLR types (user-defined conversions).   	

Book answer:
1) ArrayLists are nongeneric; they can only work with items of type object. Because of
this, you have to box and unbox your calculation parameters each time you use them.
Switching to a generic collection will avoid all the boxing and unboxing and will improve
performance.

2) Throwing and catching exceptions is expensive. You can avoid the exceptions when
converting items by first making sure that the conversion is allowed by using the is
and as keywords. You can use a simple Boolean check to see whether a conversion is
allowed.

3)One thing you can do is make sure to implement implicit conversions to the CLR types
that you want to support. You could also add a helper class that aids in converting
items.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
151)You are creating a custom Distance class. You want to ease the conversion from your
Distance class to a double. What should you add?
A. Nothing; this is already possible.
B. An implicit cast operator.
C. An explicit cast operator.
D. A static Parse method.

B, when converting Distance object to a double distance no data is lost, so we can use implicit conversion.     

Book answer:
Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: A conversion between a custom class and a value type does not exist by
default.
B. Correct: Adding an implicit operator will enable users of your class to convert
between Distance and double without any extra work.
C. Incorrect: Although adding an explicit cast operator will enable users of the class
to convert from Distance to double, they will still need to explicitly cast it.
D. Incorrect: A Parse method is used when converting a string to a type. It doesn’t
add conversions from your type to another type.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
152) You want to determine whether the value of an object reference is derived from a particular
type. Which C# language feature can you use? (Choose all that apply.)
A. An as operator //When casting is not possible as returns null
B. An implicit cast //Compiler will check if types can be converted to the specified type 
C. An is operator
D. A dynamic keyword

AC

Book answer:
Correct answers: A, C
A. Correct: The as operator will return null if the conversion failed. If it succeeds, it
will return the converted object. Seeing whether the result is null enables you to
check for a valid conversion.
B. Incorrect: Implicitly casting something of type object to another type is not possible.
It would require an explicit cast.
C. Correct: The is keyword will see whether a type is derived from another type.
D. Incorrect: The dynamic keyword can be used when you want weakly typing. It will
still throw errors at runtime if an action is not possible.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
153) You are using an ArrayList as a collection for a list of Points, which are a custom struct.
You are experiencing performance problems when working with a large amount of
Points. What do you have to do?
A. Use a generic collection instead of ArrayList.
B. Change Point to be a reference type.
C. Add an implicit conversion from Point to object.
D. Make the collection of type dynamic.

A  ArrayList stores object types therefore if you use a generic collection you dont have to cast box/unbox between types     

Book answer:
Correct answer: A
A. Correct: Using a generic collection will eliminate the need to box and unbox values.
This will improve performance, especially when working with a large number
of items.
B. Incorrect: Changing Point to be a reference type could increase memory usage.
You will still have to convert from object to Point when using the nongeneric ArrayList.
C. Incorrect: Point is a struct that inherits from System.ValueType, which in turn
inherits from System.Object. The implicit conversion is already present; adding it
won’t improve performance.
D. Incorrect: Making the collection dynamic will loosen compile-time checking. It
won’t improve performance because the runtime has to do extra work.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
154) You are working with a team to create a new application for keeping track of the
inventory of a chemistry lab. Your application consists of lots of types that all participate
in making sure that items are not used by unqualified personnel, dangerous
chemicals are not used in the same room, and items are ordered as soon as the
stock is running low.
Currently, all types in the system have different access modifiers. Some types are
completely immutable; others expose all their data. You are discussing the current
problems with a colleague. He argues that all types and all type members should be
public.
1. Explain to your colleagues why making all members public isn’t the solution.
	Encapsulation is important to enforce application security, therfore you only need
	to make methods public that are used by other parts of your application. 	

2. Give an example of how a property can help with encapsulating data while still improving usability.
	You can have a protected property which encapsulates data, the protected member is only usable in derived classes 
	(improves usability by providing access of class members to derived classes).  	

3. How can interfaces be used to improve the design?
	When using interfaces you describe capabilities, this can improve the design because you describe 
	classes in terms of capabilities not what they are.	

Book answer:
1) Making each and every type public will remove all the benefits that encapsulation offers.
Encapsulating data means that the internal representation of an object is hidden
from the outside world. This prevents users of your type from setting an invalid or
inconsistent state, and also hides complexity. This makes your system more robust because
you can change implementation details while not changing the public interface
of your type.

2) Because a property offers a controlled way of accessing a field, you can run extra code
both on reading and changing the value. You can, for example, make sure that only
authorized personnel can change specific values that determine who can use a specific
chemical.

3) Because a type can implement multiple interfaces, you can use an interface to expose
only a subset of the type members. By using explicit interface implementation, you can
also hide certain members that should be visible under only certain circumstances. This
way, you can enhance the public interface of a type by exposing fewer members at a
given time.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
155)What access modifier should you use to make sure that a method in a class can only be
accessed inside the same assembly by derived types?
A. Make the class public and its members public.
B. Make the class public and its members protected.
C. Make the class internal and its members internal.
D. Make the class internal and its members protected.

D

Book answer:
Correct answer: D
A. Incorrect: A public class with public members can be accessed from other assemblies
without any restrictions.
B. Incorrect: Types in other assemblies can derive from the class and access the
protected methods.
C. Incorrect: Types in other assemblies cannot derive from the class, but other types
in the same assembly can access the method.
D. Correct: An internal class cannot be accessed outside of its assembly. The protected
methods can be accessed only by derived types.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
156) You need to expose some data from a class. The data can be read by other types but
can be changed only by derived types. What should you use?
A. A protected field
B. A public property with a protected set modifier
C. A protected property
D. A protected property with a public get modifier

B

Book answer:
Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: A protected field cannot be read by other types outside of the class.
B. Correct: A public property can be read by all other types. The protected set modifier
restricts changes to derived types.
C. Incorrect: A protected property cannot be read by other types outside of the
class.
D. Incorrect: This will generate a compile error because the accessibility modifier of
the get accessor must be more restrictive than the property. Public is less restrictive
than protected.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

157)You have a class that implements two interfaces that both have a method with the
same name. Interface IA should be the default implementation. Interface IB should be
used only in special situations. How do you implement those interfaces?
A. Implement IA implicitly and IB explicitly.
B. Implement both IA and IB explicitly.
C. Implement both IA and IB implicitly.
D. Implement IA explicitly and IB implicitly.

A

Book answer:
Correct answer: A
A. Correct: Implementing IA implicitly will make this the default implementation.
When dealing with a reference to the class, this method will be invoked. Implementing
IB explicitly will invoke the implementation for IB when dealing with a
reference to the IB interface.
B. Incorrect: When both IA and IB are implemented explicitly, you need to cast a
reference to the class to one or both interface types to invoke the method.
C. Incorrect: Implementing both IA and IB implicitly won’t allow for a different
implementation for IB.
D. Incorrect: Implementing IB implicitly makes IB the default implementation instead
of IA.

158)You are working on a brand-new web application for a real estate agent. The agent
wants to display his property on a website and ensure that users can easily search
for it. For example, a user will be able to filter the results on location, size, property
type, and price. You need to create the infrastructure that uses all the selected criteria
to filter the list of available houses.
You want to see whether you can use some of the standard interfaces from the .NET
Framework to implement your infrastructure.

1. Why does the .NET Framework offer some interfaces without any implementation?
Wouldn’t it be easier if the .NET Framework used abstract base classes?
	Interfaces describe the capabilities, for example classes that implement IComparable 
	implement the method "int CompareTo(Type object)" this method can be used by sort 
	algorithms. The .NET Framework has a lot of methods that act on objects that 
	implement a certain interface such as the List.Sort() method. 	
	
2. Would you use interface or class inheritance to create your search criteria?
	I would implement the IEnumerable and IComparable interface to filter and sort the results.

3. Which of the following interfaces would you use?
	IComparable
	IEnumerable
	IDisposable
	IUnknown
	
	I would use the IEnumerable interface, which can be used with LINQ statements to filter the results.
	Furthermore I would use the IComparable interface which can sort the results.        	
		
Book answer:
1) The problem is that C# doesn’t have multiple inheritance for classes, but you can have
multiple interface inheritance. When types such as IDisposable would be implemented
as a base class, you would be able to inherit only from that class. Inheriting from other
custom types would be impossible.

2) Implementing the search criteria can be best done through using class inheritance. By
making an abstract class that accepts an input and then executes a specific filter over
the items, you can reuse as much code as possible. The inherited criteria would need to
specify only the filter expression (maybe through a lambda) and their exact parameters
through the constructor.

3) IUnknown is not usable in this scenario; it’s only for dealing with unmanaged code.
Implementing IDisposable should be used when you are dealing with unmanaged
resources that you want to free. In this case, that’s not necessary. IComparable could
come in handy when you want to order your criteria (for example, one criterion should
execute before any of the others). IEnumerable can be used to implement the iterator
pattern on your criteria. This could give you a performance benefit. Instead of processing
all the houses at once, you can return an iterator and filter the whole set one by
one.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
159)You want to create a hierarchy of types because you have some implementation code you want to share between all types. You also have some method signatures you want to share. What should you use?
A. An interface
B. A class with virtual methods
C. An abstract class
D. A sealed class

C //share implementation code + share method signatures

Book answer:
Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: An interface won’t let you share any implementation code, only the
public member signatures.
B. Incorrect: A class requires you to have an implementation for every member. It
doesn’t give you the option to only declare a member signature.
C. Correct: An abstract class enables you to share both implemented methods and
method signatures that a derived class needs to implement.
D. Incorrect: A sealed class can’t be inherited.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
160)You want to create a type that can be easily sorted. Which interface should you implement?
A. IEnumerable
B. IComparable
C. IDisposable
D. IUnknown

B //You need to implement int CompareTo(Type object) method, returns 0 if object at same position, if > 0 increase its position in list, if < 0 decrease its position in list 


Book answer:
Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: IEnumerable should be implemented on collection-like types so they
can be easily iterated over.
B. Correct: IComparable enables objects to be compared to each other. It returns
an integer value that represents the relative position as smaller than 0, 0 or larger
than 0.
C. Incorrect: IDisposable should be implemented on types that access unmanaged
resources and that need to release them.
D. Incorrect: IUnknown is used only when working with the COM.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
161) You want to inherit from an existing class and add some behavior to a method. Which steps do you have to take? (Choose all that apply.)
A. Use the abstract keyword on the base type.
B. Use the virtual keyword on the base method.
C. Use the new keyword on the derived method.
D. Use the override keyword on the derived method.

B, D 

Book answer:
Correct answers: B, D
A. Incorrect: When you mark the base type as abstract, you can’t create an instance
of it. You can’t use both the base and the derived type as concrete types in your
code.
B. Correct: Marking the method in the base class as virtual enables it to be overridden
by derived classes.
C. Incorrect: The new keyword hides the method in the base class. You shouldn’t use
it when you want to extend the behavior from the base class.
D. Correct: The override keyword enables you to override a method marked as virtual
in a base class.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
162) You are creating your own optimized object-relational mapper. You allow the user
to map types one-on-one to a table in the database. You also use special attributes
for security reasons. For example, a type can be decorated with an AuthorizeAttribute
to make sure that only specific users can access a certain table. You use a lot
of reflection in your app and you start seeing some performance problems. You are
also thinking about a generator that will create types that map exactly to an existing
database.

1. Why do you use an attribute instead of inheriting from an interface? Wouldn’t
that be easier than adding a whole new concept to C#
	Attributes give information about a class, Attributes dont add functionalities/capabilities   
	to a class as interfaces do. Using reflection you can see which attributes decorate a class
	and you can act on that information.

2. What can you do about the performance problems with using reflection?
	Using reflection to retrieve class information is more CPU intensive than when instantiating/using an class object directly.
		
3. Which technique would you use to create your generator?
	I would read the database information (types present in table) and I would use CodeDOM to generate C# class 
	that can be used to map Database columns to c# types.    	
	
Book answer:
1) Although interface inheritance describes an “is-a-kind-of” relation, but you can’t say
that your type is “a kind of AuthorizedObject.” Instead, you use attributes to say something
about another type, which is why C# contains metadata. Inheritance should not
be used to decorate a type with certain information.

2) Reflection can be a really slow process. You can replace reflection with expression
trees. When you are mapping data to a custom type, you can build an expression tree
(and cache it!). The expression tree can be compiled to native code. Of course, you will
still have the penalty of doing this extra step, but it will be much faster than reflection.

3) For generating code, you can use the CodeDOM. A CompilationUnit created by the
CodeDOM can be outputted as a source file.

163) You want to read the value of a private field on a class. Which BindingFlags do you need? (Choose all that apply.)
A. Instance
B. DeclaredOnly
C. Static
D. NonPublic

A, D

Book answer:
1. Correct answers: A, D
A. Correct: The field is a nonstatic instance field.
B. Incorrect: DeclaredOnly is used when you don’t want to include inherited members.
C. Incorrect: The field is not static; it’s a per-instance field.
D. Correct: Nonpublic is necessary because the field is private
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
164) You need to create an attribute that can be applied multiple times on a method or a parameter. Which syntax should you use?

A.[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.GenericParameter | AttributeTargets.Method,AllowMultiple = true)]
B.[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Method | AttributeTargets.Parameter, AllowMultiple = true)]
C.[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.All)]
D.[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Method | AttributeTargets.Parameter)]

B

Book answer:
Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: The AttributeTargets.GenericParameter can be applied to generic parameters.
It’s not used for regular method arguments.
B. Correct: The Attribute targets both Methods and Parameters. It can also be applied
multiple times.
C. Incorrect: With AttributeTargets.All, the attribute can be applied to all types. It
also can’t be applied multiple times.
D. Incorrect: Because AllowMultiple is false by default, this attribute can’t be applied
multiple times.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
165) You want to create a delegate that can filter a list of strings on a specific value. Which type should you use?
A. Action<bool, IEnumerable<string>>.
B. Func<IEnumerable<string>, IEnumerable<string>>.
C. Func<string, IEnumerable<string>, IEnumerable<string>>.
D. Func<IEnumerable<string>>.

C The delegate accepts a string (with a specific value to filter on) a list of strings and returns a filterd string list   

Book answer:
Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: An Action doesn’t return a value. It also takes a Boolean input instead of
the list of strings and the filter value.
B. Incorrect: This delegate doesn’t have a parameter for the value to filter on.
C. Correct: It takes both the input list and the value to filter on and returns the
filtered list.
D. Incorrect: This returns only a list of strings. It doesn’t have an argument for the
filter parameter or the original list.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
166) Can a JSON document contain binary data?

No, but data in the form  of a byte array (which contains binary data) can be serialized/deserialized
Serialization can be defined as the process of storing the state of an object to a storage medium. During this process, the public and private fields of the object and the name of the class, including the assembly containing the class, are converted to a stream of bytes, which is then written to a data stream. When the object is subsequently deserialized, an exact clone of the original object is created.

Book answer:
Binary data includes things like images and sounds, which are comprised of
a large number of values. A JSON document can only contain elements that
can be represented by text, so binary values are converted into text (using an
encoding called base64) by Json.NET before they are added to the
document.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
167) Can a JSON document contain a structure?

Yes, you can serialize and deserialize structure types.   

Book answer:
A JSON document can contain class or struct types.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
168) Does a program run faster if it uses untyped collection classes?

No, when you use untyped collection classes (such as ArrayList) a lot of boxing/unboxing is taking place which slows down performance.
Therefore you can better use generic collections such as List<T>  

Book answer:
An untyped collection manages all of the elements that it stores in terms of
references to objects. It is arguable that this might slightly increase the speed
of adding and removing objects from the collection, because the collection
will not be performing any type validation as the program runs. However,
the speed increase will be barely measurable. The benefits of using typed
collections and discovering type errors at compile time, rather than when the
program runs, far outweigh any performance gains that might accrue from
using untyped collections.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
169) You want to count the number of occurrences of different words in a
document. What data structure should you use?

You can use StringCollection to add all the different words and when you are finished you can use LINQ to group the words and display the number of occurences of each word.    
StringCollection implements the IEnumerable interface, hence you can use LINQ queries on the collection. 

Book answer:
The best way to do this is to use a dictionary of integers indexed on a string.
The integer in the dictionary holds the count of that word, and the index is
the word itself. When the document is being processed, each word is
isolated in turn. If the word is not present in the dictionary, it is added to the
dictionary, and the count for that word is set to 1. If the word is present in
the dictionary, the count for that word is incremented.

Dictionary<string, int> dic = new Dictionary<string, int>();
foreach (string word in words)
{
	string wordLower = word.ToLower();
	//Check if Dictionary contains the current word.  
	if (dic.ContainsKey(wordLower))
	{ //Dictionary contains the current word, increment counter.
		dic[wordLower]++;
	}
	else
	{ ////Dictionary does not contain the current word, add it to dictionary
		dic.Add(wordLower, 1);
	}
}

//Order the dictionary by word occurence
var orderedDictionary = from keyValuePair in dic
					   orderby keyValuePair.Value descending
					   select keyValuePair;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
170) What is the difference between model, view, and controller? Why do we
have them?

In an MVC webapplication, the view is what the user sees (generally build in HTML, Razor), the controller communicates between the model and View.
The Model contains application classes/models and business rules. A controller class can serve/update multiple views.          
We use the MVC pattern because we want to have a well designed Web application (Which is easier to maintain because we have a separation of concerns).

Book answer:
The model holds the data; the view is generated to show the user some
information about the model (there may be multiple views), and the
controller generates the information to populate the view and responds to
messages from the views. In ASP.NET terms, the model is the database
connection. The view is the HTML web endpoints, and the controllers are
C# classes bound to events produced by the views. You have this separation
so that the different elements provide a “separation of concerns.” The creator
of the data store doesn’t have to consider how the information will be
presented, and the view doesn’t have to contain any of the programmatic
behaviors of the application. The controller can focus on the actions to be
performed to generate the user interface and update the data store.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
171)What would you do if you wanted to add publisher information to the
MusicTracks application that were implemented using ASP.NET.

You can add a publisher class containing publisher info, the MusicTrack object will then contain a reference to a publisher object.  
The publisher class is added in the model folder. In order to display publisher info, we need to modify the controller class and the View.

Book answer:
If the publisher is a simple string that gives the publisher name, it can be
added as another property in the MusicTrack class. It makes sense to
create a new Publisher class that is added to the models for the application.
A MusicTrack instance contains a “foreign key” that identifies the
particular Publisher record associated with the track. Once the changes have
been made, the new class can migrate into the Entity Framework model for
the application, and the web page views updated to show the new publisher
information.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
172)What would you do if you wanted to view all the tracks recorded by a
particular artist in the MusicTracks application that you implemented
using ASP.NET.

You can use a LINQ query to select all the tracks recorded by a particular artist.
This is done in the model and the list is returned from the model to the controller and displayed in the view.

Book answer:
This requires the creation of an additional view of the document that takes
the form of an additional web page that allows the artist to be selected and
the tracks displayed. The behavior to obtain the information is added to an
existing controller class, or a new controller class can be created.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
173) Are there any situations in which a data variable in a class should be made
public?

Yes, for example when you use XMLserialization of an object, the properties to be serialized need to be public.  
Furthermore a data variable can be made public if other parts of the software need to access it.   

Book answer:
The only situation in which I consider it to be acceptable for data in a class
to be made public is if you are highly concerned about performance, and the
effect of damage to the object is not critical. For example, when writing a
game I would make public the positions of the objects on the screen and the
images that are displayed when they are drawn on the screen. This improves
performance, and if the values are corrupted, the game may not behave as it
should, but I consider that the effect of any error will not be expensive or
dangerous.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
174) Is it always bad for a method to have “side effects”?

Yes when you call a method you want defined behaviour to be executed without any side effects.  

Book answer:
A side effect of a method is some change it makes in the environment
around it. Using side-effects can improve performance, and a method might
have an effect on an object that is passed as a parameter, but try to avoid side
effects because they can be confusing for anyone trying to understand a
program that they haven’t seen before.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
175) What is the difference between a “deep” and a “shallow” copy of an object?

When you copy an object that contains references to other objects, you can just copy the already existing references in your copy (shallow copy),
or you can create new referenced objects in your copy (deep copy)      

Book answer:
An object may contain references to other objects. If you make a shallow
copy of the object, the references themselves are copied. If you make a deep
copy of the object, each of the objects that the references refer to is also
copied.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
176) Why do you never have to create a copy constructor for a structure?

A structure is a value type, when you pass a struct instance to a method a copy is created that is passed to the method.  

Book answer:
A structure may not need a copy constructor, because whenever you assign a
structure value, the values in the structure are already copied. In other
words, assigning one struct variable to another performs a “shallow” copy of
the data in the source structure. However, if the source structure contains
references to other objects, you will need to create a copy constructor to
perform a “deep copy” of the structure.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
177) When should you consider risk in software development?

When developing a UI with fields that can be filled in by the application user, 
you need to consider the risk that application user tries to exploit the application by entering malicious input.
Risk is a calculated assessment of possible abuse of user input in application and worse case consequences in the application.            

Book answer:
You should consider risk at all stages of development. It is not enough to
perform a risk analysis at the start of the project and then assume that all
risks have been addressed. Risks should be monitored and the search for
new risks should continue during the project development.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
178) What is a regular expression?

Regular expression are text patterns that can be used to validate/replace texts that match the regular expression text pattern.   

Book answer:
A regular expression can be used to match the contents of a string. A simple
regular expression, such as the string “Rob,” matches the string “Rob.” You
can add elements to the expression to identify ranges of characters to match
and give alternatives to match. They can be used to identify elements to be
edited, but also to determine if an input string matches the expression. In this
second role, they are very useful for data validation.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
179) Can you only use regular expressions in C# programs? 

Regular expressions can be used by a wide range of programming languages.   

Book answer:
Regular expressions can be used in a wide range of operating systems and
programming languages.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
180) When in a project should you consider the use of encryption?

In software projects that expose data (in a file or internet communication) that can be modified/abused by others and have big consequences for the application.  

Book answer:
You should consider which elements in an application require encryption
right at the start of the development process. This is a return to the riskbased
approach to design, where you consider the chances of an exploit and
the impact that such an exploit should have.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
181) What is the difference between encoding and encryption?

Encoding is the process of transforming a set of Unicode characters into a sequence of bytes. In contrast, decoding is the process of transforming a sequence of encoded bytes into a set of Unicode characters. Encryption is used to obfuscate text content (Unicode characters) so that its content cannot be read by third parties.  

Book answer:
Encoding is a process which takes data and represents it in some way. The
UNICODE standard is a way of encoding character data into particular
numeric values, for example the letter A could be encoded into the
UNICODE value 65. Encryption is a process that takes data and converts it
into a form where it must be decrypted before it can be read. In other words,
encoding keeps the meaning of the data, whereas encryption tries to hide it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
182) Is it really impossible to encrypt data without using a key?

No, you can use several technieks, such as a book and use the page number and letter number to encrypt a letter.   

Book answer:
Encryption without using a key is very dangerous, and very open to attack.
This technology is more often called “obfuscation,” which is the process of
making something hard to read. Obfuscation has its place in application
development. If you are distributing compiled code and you don’t want other
developers to be able to decompile and read your source you can pass the
assemblies through an “obfuscator,” which will remove all of the
meaningful variable names and introduce extra constructions to confuse the
meaning of the source.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
183) Can you encrypt using a private key?

Yes, for example when you sign a message, you use a hash algorithm to calculate a hash value which you encrypt with your private key (using private key of certificate).
The recipient can then use the public key (senders certificate) to decrypt the signiture and validate the message, this verifies the identity of the sender 
and verifies that content is not tampered with.  

Book answer:
You can encrypt using your private key, but since the public key is public,
there is not a lot of point in doing this for data protection, as anyone can
obtain your public key and use it to decrypt the data. However, encrypting
with a private key is useful if you want to prove the origins of a document. It
is the basis of document signing.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
184) What happens if you lose your private key?

Your encryption key pair is compromised and cannot be safely used anymore, 
furthermore you are unable to decrypt messages signed with the public key.

Book answer:
If you lose your private key you will be unable to read any messages that
have been encoded with your public key. There is no “back door” that will
allow you to recover your key from your public key. This is why computers
have key stores and certificate stores built into them, so that the user doesn’t
need to worry about this.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
185)Can you encrypt a large document using asymmetric encryption? If not, how
do you securely send a large document to someone you’ve never met?

When using asymmetric encryption to securely send a large document, this will take relative a long time to encrypt the document.   
You can combine asymmetric and symmetric encryption to send the large document. Use asymmetric encryption to send a symmetrical key,
next encrypt the large document using the symmetrical key and send it to the receiver which already obtained the symmetrical key (was send earlier).

Book answer:
Asymmetric encryption is not suitable for encrypting large documents.
There are two reasons for this. First, the process is quite processor intensive.
Second, the larger the encrypted message the more vulnerable that message
is to a “brute force” attack to determine the keys used to encrypt it. If you
want to send someone a large, secret, document you should do this by using
asymmetric encryption to securely obtain a symmetric key from the
document recipient and then use this key to send the document using
symmetric encryption.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
186) Does signing a document keep it secret?

No, it only guarantees the integrity of the document which means that the document was not altered,
Furthermore the signing of a document guarantees the identity of the sender.    

Book answer:
Signing a document is a way of proving that the document is authentic. It
allows the recipient to be confident that they know who sent the document
and that the contents of the document have not been tampered with.
However, signing a document does not protect the contents of the document
from being read.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
187) What is “padding”?

Adding data to data. 

Book answer:
The same message encrypted using RAS always produces the same output.
Padding adds randomness to a message so that the same text always appears
different. It is added and removed by the encryption and decryption process.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
188) Is it hard to add encryption to an existing .NET application?

No,  

Book answer:
Adding encryption to the movement of data is easy because the encryption
process for symmetric encryption is implemented as a stream that can be
inserted into the data movement process. The hardest aspect of adding
encryption will be the management of the keys.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
189) Is it hard to change from one encryption algorithm to another in a .NET
program?

No, all encryptions in .NET derive from the same abstract SymmetricAlgorithm class therefore they implement almost the same methods which
allows you to easily change one encryption algorithm to another.  

Book answer:
All the encryption classes in the System.Security.Cryptography
namespace are child classes of the SymmetricAlgorithm class, so
switching to another encryption method is easy. However, you may have to
handle existing data that has been encoded using the previous algorithm.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
190) Can you prove your identity without using a certification authority?

No, unless you physically meet each other and exchange public keys. 

Book answer:
Proving your identity to someone without a certification authority means
physically meeting them and showing them your drivers ID or some other
physical proof of identity. If you do this and give them a USB memory key
with your key files on it, that might work.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
191) Why can’t you use asymmetric encryption to encrypt a stream?

Asymmetric encryption requires a lot of CPU time to encrypt a stream, therfore asymmetric encryption can not keep up encrypting a stream.     

Book answer:
You should not use asymmetric encryption to encrypt large amounts of data,
because it might be passed through a stream. Asymmetric encryption is
demanding on the processor and vulnerable to attack if used for large
amounts of data.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
192) What does it mean when a hashing algorithm is considered compromised?

Hashing different contents produces the same hash value.   

Book answer:
If a hashing algorithm is described as compromised, it means that techniques
have been discovered that allow the contents of a document to be changed
without the hash value (manifest) changing.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
193) How would you write your own hashing algorithm for your own data types?

You can combine the values of the members of your data types and create a unique value.     
For example a class that consists of two strings and two ints, you can combine the values and create a unique identity hash.  

Book answer:
The object class contains a virtual method called GetHash(), which is
used within .NET to calculate a value that represents the content of the
object. You can overload this method in your types so that it uses the
contents of the object to generate a value that represents those contents.
However, it is not possible to create a cryptographically secure hash value
this way as the result of the GetHash method is only a single integer. An
integer value is useful in a data management context, but for document
signing we need a bigger hash code. You therefore have to create your own
hashing technology. One way is to combine elements in the object into a
block of bytes and then use an SHA2 method to create a manifest from this block.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
194) How should you organize the elements in my assemblies?

When you design an application, you create assemblies that represent a specific functionality, for example language translator functionality.      
So an application is divided in different assemblies each with a specific functionality.    
Each assembly can be organised in a folder assets and folders that describes the functionality such as Helpers (Containing helper classes), Enums, Converters.       

Book answer:
It makes sense to organize the elements in an assembly on the basis of
function. The data access elements can be placed in one assembly, the
business model behaviors in another and the user interface in a third. You
should be mindful of dependencies when you design your assemblies, so
ideally you should not have two assemblies that each contain classes that are
dependent on each other.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
195)What is there a difference between an assembly written in C# and one
written in Visual Basic .NET?

The sourcecode files are compiled into MISL (MS intermediate language). 
The difference is the sourcecode (C#, Visual Basic) the generated code is the same MISL.

Book answer:
Because the assembly contains the compiled code there should be no
difference in the MSIL produced for the different languages. I’ve actually
done tests where I’ve written the same code in both languages and then
compared the MSIL files and they are essentially the same.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
196) Can a library assembly contain a main method?

No, only executables have a main method. 

Book answer:
A library assembly should not have an entry point. An assembly is always
loaded by a program that is already executing.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
197)Why does the manifest for an assembly contain a reference to the mscorelib
as well as any other assembly libraries that it uses?

“mscorlib” is an abbreviation for Multi-language Standard Common Object Runtime Library
mscorlib.dll is an assembly which contains the most basic types needed by any .NET application.

Book answer:
An assembly is not just dependent on components that we have written. It
can also be dependent on the behavior of system routines. If an assembly
specifies the particular version of a system library that it will use this means
that it will not be affected by changes to that library?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
198)Why does Microsoft bother with the intermediate language? Surely a
program would start up more quickly if it didn’t have to be compiled before
it can be run?

The advantage of using the intermediate language (MSIL) is that jou can use different languages (C#, F#, Visual Basic)  
to create the same assemblies. The JIT (Just In Time Compiler) compiles the intermediate language (MSIL) to machine code
for different platforms. If you directly create machine code after compilation, you would not be able to create machine code that is platform independent.    


Book answer:
The Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) adds a great deal of
flexibility. A system can support multiple programming languages and can
also execute on a range of systems. The use of MSIL also makes it easy to
create an application out of several different programming languages.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
199) Can two strong-named assemblies ever have the same fully qualified name?

No, only if someone makes a mistake and does not increment the version number when releasing a new version of the assembly.   

Book answer:
The fully qualified name of an assembly uses a hash of the public key of the
assembly as part of the name. As we saw when we discussed encryption in
the previous section, it is not guaranteed that two different key values 
create different hash values, but this is so unlikely as to be impossible. We
can say that it is sufficiently unlikely for two names to be different for us not
to have to worry about it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
200) Does the use of .NET assemblies mean that the computer might have
multiple versions of the same library dll loaded at the same time?

Yes, for example you could have two applications that use different versions of the same assembly(because of side loading when using strong named assemblies).

Book answer:
A machine might have multiple versions of a particular library in the Global
Assembly Cache (GAC). This might sound like a waste of space but
remember that the GAC is just file storage. The libraries are only loaded into
memory when they are required by an application. Fortunately, .NET came
along at a time when the price and capacity of storage space meant that
storing multiple versions of libraries is not a problem for modern systems.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
201) Why don’t we put all of our assemblies in the Global Assembly Cache?

It only makes sense to install assemblies in the Global Assembly Cache if the same assemblies are used by multiple different applications.
In this way you can share assemblies. Another advantage is that assemblies can only be removed from the GAC by an administrator.     
Another advantage is that using newer versions of assemblies in the Global Assembly Cache can be accomplished 
without recompiling the application, using assambly redirection (.config file).  
 
Book answer:
The Global Assembly Cache (GAC) is intended to provide a means by
which applications can share assemblies. The word cache implies that
elements in it will somehow be loaded more quickly, but this is not the case
with the GAC.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
202) When does the C# pre-processor run? 

When the compiler starts to run and generates MSIL the C# pre-processor directives are read and processed.     

Book answer:
The C# pre-processor runs when the compiler starts running. It opens the file
and reads lines looking for pre-processor directives; these are statements that
start with a # character.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
203) Can you use the #if conditional compilation directive to test the value of a
variable?

No, the #if conditional must be defined at compile-time, variables are given a value when the application runs.     

Book answer:
The #if conditional compilation directive performs a test when the program
is compiled, not when it runs. So, it cannot test the contents of any variable
because at this point the variables have not been given any values.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
204)Some of the lines in the Visual Studio editor are gray. Why is this?

This means the grayed out code is not included in the MSIL code generated by the compiler due to conditional compilation directives.   

Book answer:
Visual Studio is aware of pre-processor directives. In fact, you can regard
the Visual Studio text editor as having a pre-processor built-in. This means
that it is able to identify which lines will not be compiled because of preprocessor
directives. It draws these lines grayed out.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
205) Visual Studio is telling you that none of the breakpoints will be hit. Why is
this?

When you run your code in release mode, none of the breakpoints will be hit.

Book answer:
If your breakpoints suddenly become unusable, this is usually because the
build type for the project is now release rather than debug. The release
version of a program contains optimizations that mean the running code may
not perform actions in the same sequence as the compiled source. This
makes it impossible to set breakpoints and step through the code. The other
reason for breakpoints being unavailable is if the program debug database is
not accessible.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
206) What type of data is a symbol defined by the #define directive?

The type of data is string (#define DEBUG, #define TRACE).
The #define directive result in a Boolean, because a #define directive is defined or not (true or false).

Book answer:
The #defined directive creates a symbol. The symbol itself does not hold any
data. The fact that the symbol exists is what we are interested in, not what
the symbol contains. This is different behavior from the languages C and
C++, where defined symbols can contain values.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
207) Do you always have to #define my symbols in my program source files?

No, you can also use Project->Properties UI of VS to define symbols (TRACE and DEBUG can be checked/unchecked in this UI)

Book answer:
You can #define symbols at the top of source files, but you can also define
symbols in the Visual Studio project for an application.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
208) Can a program create a #define symbol when it runs?

The only possibility I can think off is when you generate code using CodeDom when an application runs. The code generated can contain #define symbols.
The generated code then needs to be compiled and run.  
 
Book answer:
By the time a program runs the pre-processor is long gone. The preprocessor
just controls what code statements are processed by the C#
compiler, so there is no way that a running program can create #define symbols.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
209)Can you use the #pragma pre-processor directive to ignore compilation
errors?

No, it would not make any sense to ignore compilation errors because you would not be able to get resulting MSIL assemblies due to the error.

Book answer:
The #pragma directive tells the compiler to ignore all, or nominated,
warnings. It is not possible to make the compiler ignore compilation errors.
This would be a very dangerous thing to do.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
210)Do you need to copy the program debug database to the customer when you
ship the product?

No, because a customer is not going to debug your application.

Book answer:
The user of your program has no particular use for a program debug
database, but it can be a good idea to provide the file to them. For one thing,
the error reports produced by the program can contain more detail. For
another, if you want to try remote debugging of the application it is useful to
have the file on the machine.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
211) A fellow programmer wants to discard all their program database files. Why
is this a bad idea?

Because if you want to debug your application or previous releases you need the corresponding pdb (Debug Database). 

Book answer:
It would be a very bad idea to delete the program database files. While they
are not needed to run the application, they are vital for debugging. If a pdb
file is lost, it cannot be recreated because any new file will not have the
same GUID as the original and will not be recognized by the debugger. It is
possible to send a compiled application to a customer without the pdb files,
but the files themselves should be retained.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
212) What is the effect on performance of using a symbol server when
debugging?

It slows down performance. 
When a debugger searches for symbols, it first searches locally. Then it looks on symbol servers. When it finds a matching symbol, it transfers the symbol file to your local cache. The symbols for a typical DLL or executable file range from 1 to 100 MB in size. Therefore, if you are debugging a process that includes many DLLs, it can take some time to resolve all the symbols and transfer them to a local cache.

Book answer:
A symbol server provides program debug database information to a program
in place of a local program debug database file. The symbols are accessed
via a network connection. This means that loading an assembly might take
longer as the debug symbols are loaded. This can result in a slowdown of the
application.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
213) A user needs to enter a DateTime in a text field. You need to parse the value in code.
Which method do you use?

A. DateTime.Parse
B. DateTime.TryParse //Does not throw an exception when DateTime value entered is invalid.
C. Convert.ToDateTime
D. Regex.Match.

A, B, C These functions convert a string to a DateTime Type (struct). Regex.Match validates whether the input string conforms to the expected DateTime string format.

Book answer:
Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: Parse will throw an exception when the user enters an invalid date,,
which is not uncommon.
B. Correct: TryParse will see whether the entered value is a valid date. If not, it will
return gracefully instead of throwing an exception.
C. Incorrect: Convert.ToDateTime uses Parse internally. This will throw an exception
when entered data is in the wrong format.
D. Incorrect: RegEx.Match can be used to see whether the input is a valid date. It
can’t convert the input string to a DateTime object.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
214)You are working on a globalized web application. You need to parse a text field where
the user enters an amount of money. Which method do you use?
A. int.TryParse(value, NumberStyles.Currency, UICulture);
B. decimal.TryParse(value, NumberStyles.Currency, UICulture);
C. decimal.TryParse(value, ServerCulture);
D. decimal.TryParse(value)

B public static bool TryParse (string s, System.Globalization.NumberStyles style, IFormatProvider provider, out decimal result);

Book answer:
Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: Money should not be stored in an integer because it can’t store decimal
numbers.
B. Correct: You need to specify the NumberStyles.Currency and the culture that the
user is using to parse the Currency formatting correctly.
C. Incorrect: Using the server culture doesn’t account for the differences in user
culture. You also need the NumberStyles.Currency parameter to make sure the user
can enter a currency symbol.
D. Incorrect: Leaving off the culture defaults to the culture of the operating system.
You also need the NumberStyles.Currency parameter to make sure the user can
enter a currency symbol.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
215) You need to validate an XML file. What do you use?
A. JavaScriptSerializer
B. RegEx
C. StringBuilder
D. XSD

D XML scheme (XSD) is used to validate XML files. 

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
216) You have developed a complex web application and deployed it to production. The
application is a new hybrid of wiki and a forum. Users can use it to brainstorm on
ideas and write a document together.
Suddenly users start contacting your support desk. They are all reporting ”that your
application looks strange.” It suddenly contains extra URLs that link to external
websites that are mixed with the original website’s layout.

1. What could be the problem?
This is possible the result of wrong/malicious input which is then (wrongly) processed resulting in extra URLs(to external websites) in the website’s layout. 

2. How will you solve it?
Validate the user input fields and change the processing of entered URL links.

Book answer:
1. It looks like malicious users are entering HTML in the text fields. This data gets submitted
to the server and rendered the next time the page is viewed.
2. You need to use regular expressions to restrict the user input. By making clear which
characters you allow, you can strip the input of the HTML characters and make sure
they are not showing up in the page layout.

217)Bob and Alice are using an asymmetric algorithm to exchange data. Which key should
they send to the other party to make this possible?

A. Bob sends Alice his private key, and Alice sends Bob her public key.
B. Bob sends Alice his private key, and Alice sends Bob her private key.
C. Bob sends Alice his public key, and Alice sends Bob her public key.
D. Bob sends Alice his public key, and Alice sends Bob her private key.

C the public keys can be used to encrypt messages which you can only decrypt with the corresponding private key.    

Book answer:
Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: The private key should always be kept confidential.
B. Incorrect: The private key should always be kept confidential.
C. Correct: By sending each other their public key, they can then encrypt data with
the other party’s public key to send them data.
D. Incorrect: The private key should always be kept confidential.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
218) You need to encrypt a large amount of data. Which algorithm do you use?
A. SHA256
B. RSACryptoServiceProvider
C. MD5CryptoServiceProvider
D. AesManaged

D use Advanced Encryption standard 

Book answer:
Correct answer: D
A. Incorrect: SHA256 is a hashing algorithm. It can’t be used to encrypt data.
B. Incorrect: RSACryptoServiceProvider is an asymmetric encryption algorithm.
Asymmetric algorithms are not suited for encrypting large amounts of data.
C. Incorrect: MD5CryptoServiceProvider is a hashing algorithm. It can’t be used to
encrypt data.
D. Correct: AesManaged is a symmetric algorithm that can be used to encrypt large
amounts of data.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
219)You need to send sensitive data to another party and you want to make sure that no
one tampers with the data. Which method do you use?

A. X509Certificate2.SignHash
B. RSACryptoServiceProvider.Encrypt
C. UnicodeEncoding.GetBytes
D. Marshal.ZeroFreeBSTR

A) If you want to make sure no one tampers with the data, you can sign the data using the private key of your certificate.
The receiver can use the public key published in the certificate to compare the signed hash value with the calculated value
and verify that the message has the orignal content. 
         
Book answer:
Correct answers: A, C
A. Correct: Using the digital certificate X509 can be used to sign hashed data. If the
other party uses the Verify method, it can check that the hash hasn’t changed.
B. Incorrect: This method encrypts the data with an asymmetric algorithm. It doesn’t
ensure that the data hasn’t been tampered with.
C. Correct: UnicodeEncoding.GetBytes converts a string to a byte sequence. It doesn’t
protect the data in any way.
D. Incorrect: The Marshal class should be used when working with System.SecureString.
The ZeroFreeBSTR method can be used to zero out an area of memory that contained
an insecure string.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
220)You are working on an application that helps users track their time and shows them
when they are most productive. The application runs on a server with a web client, desktop,
and mobile front end being developed with the .NET Framework.
You are assigned the task of determining which security features should be used in
the application.

Make a list of the possible technologies that can be used to secure the application.

User must login on the application using a password and username, the hash value of the password can be stored in the database to authenticate users.
Furthermore you can secure the communication between clients and server using asymmetric encryption to distribute symmetric keys, the  
symmetric keys can then be used to encrypt communication between client and server.        

Book answer:
1) Digital certificates to make sure the application can be safely installed on desktop
machines.
2) Asymmetric encryption to send data to the server by using the public key to encrypt
the data.
3) Asymmetric encryption to send data from the server to the client. The server encrypts
with the private key; the client decrypts with the public key.
4) Code access permissions to make sure that your application can run in sandboxed
environments.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
221) You are building a strong-named assembly and you want to reference a regular assembly to reuse some code you built. What do you have to do?
A. You first need to put the assembly in the GAC.
B. Nothing. Referencing another assembly to use some code is always possible.
C. You need to sign the other assembly before using it.
D. You need to use the public key token of the other assembly to reference it.

C, strong-named assemblies can only reference strong-named assemblies, this helps to maintain application integrity    

Book answer:
Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: An assembly in the GAC needs to be strongly named. Your assembly still
won’t be able to reference the nonsigned assembly.
B. Incorrect: A strong-named assembly cannot reference a non-strong-named assembly.
C. Correct: You need to strongly name the other assembly before you can reference it.
D. Incorrect: The public key token is a part of the manifest of a strong-named assembly.
The non-strong-named assembly doesn’t have this key information. It needs to
be strongly named first.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
222) You are building an assembly that will be used by a couple of server applications. You want to make the update process of this assembly as smooth as possible. Which steps should you take? (Choose all that apply.)
A. Create a WinMD Metadata file.
B. Deploy the assembly to the GAC.
C. Add an assemblyBinding section to each client application that points to the location of the assembly.
D. Strongly name the assembly.

B, D //Before you can deploy the assembly to the GAC you need to sign it (Strongly name the assembly)  

Book answer:
Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: A WinMD file is used by the WinRT in Windows 8. It shouldn’t be used
outside of this context.
B. Correct: A shared assembly can be deployed in the GAC. Other applications can
reference it there. When you want to update it, you can do so by deploying the
new version to the GAC. By using configuration files, you can then let other applications
reference your new assembly.
C. Incorrect: You can use the assemblyBinding configuration element to add extra
search locations for an assembly. This would ask for changes to each client application,
however. The GAC is the location where a shared assembly needs to be
deployed.
D. Incorrect: Strongly naming an assembly doesn’t make it a shared assembly. Each
application would still require its own copy.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
223) You want to deploy an assembly to a shared location on the intranet. Which steps should you take? (Choose all that apply.)
A. Strongly name the assembly.
B. Use the codebase configuration element in the applications to use the assembly.
C. Deploy the assembly to the GAC.
D. Use the assemblyBinding configuration element with the probing option.

A, B, When the shared assembly is accessed it is downloaded to a separate folder in GAC  

Book answer:
Correct answers: A, B
A. Correct: Strongly naming the assembly is required to be able to reference it on
the intranet.
B. Correct: The codebase configuration element can be used to have local client applications
know they can find an assembly on another location such as the intranet.
C. Incorrect: Deploying it to the GAC won’t put the assembly on the intranet.
D. Incorrect: The probing option can be used only to give additional locations relative
to the application path. It can’t be used to point to the intranet.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
224)You are ready to deploy your code to a production server. Which configuration do you
deploy?

A. Debug configuration
B. Release configuration
C. Custom configuration with PDB files
D. Release configuration built with the /debug:full compiler flag

B

Book answer:
Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: A debug configuration is not fully optimized and is not suitable for a
production environment.
B. Correct: A release configuration is fully optimized and will give the best results in
a production environment.
C. Incorrect: PDB files are necessary only when debugging an application.
D. Incorrect: The /debug:full flag adds extra information to your application for debugging
purposes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
225)You are debugging an application for a web shop and are inspecting a lot of Order
classes. What can you do to make your debugging easier?

A. Use the DebuggerDisplayAttribute on the Order class.
B. Override ToString on the Order class.
C. Use the Conditional Attribute on the Order class.
D. Use the #line compiler directive to make sure you can find the correct location
when an exception occurs.

A

Book answer:
Correct answer: A
A. Correct: The DebuggerDisplayAttribute helps you in supplying a more helpful
description when inspecting an item through the debugger.
B. Incorrect: Overriding ToString does help, but a better solution is to use the DebuggerDisplayAttribute
because this won’t influence your code in production.
C. Incorrect: The ConditionalAttribute can be used to remove code from your compiled
application. Most of the time, it’s used to remove certain calls when doing a
release build.
D. Incorrect: The #line directive is used to change the line numbers of your code.
Normally, this won’t be necessary.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
226) You are using custom code generation to insert security checks into your classes. When
an exception happens, you’re having troubling finding the correct line in your source
code. What should you do?
A. Use #error to signal the error from your code so that it’s easier to find.
B. Use #line hidden to hide unnecessary lines from the debugger.
C. Use the ConditionalAttribute to remove the security checks from your debug build.
D. Use the #line directive with the correct line numbers in your generated code to
restore the original line numbers.

D

Book answer:
Correct answer: D
A. Incorrect: #error will signal an error at compile time.
B. Incorrect: #line hidden will remove the extra generated lines from the debugger,
but it won’t restore your line numbers.
C. Incorrect: This is a dangerous solution because it creates different behavior
between debug and release builds. You won’t be able to test your security checks
while working with a debug build.
D. Correct: The #line directive can be used to tell the compiler to change the line
number of a line of code. This way, you can remove the line numbers for the generated
code so that exceptions will match the original code.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
227)You are working in the support department of your organization. A customer
phones you to report an error in a web application that you are hosting on your
own servers.
1. You want to start debugging this application remotely.

2. Do you need to deploy a debug version to the server?
You need to deploy the Debug Database in order to get detailed error information. 

3. What do you need to make this possible?
Copy the right version Debug Database to the application directory on the server. 

4. How can a Symbol Server help you?

Book answer:
1. No, you don’t have to do this. Although a debug version will contain more information,
you can debug the release version if you have the correct PDB file.
2. You need to make sure that you have the correct PDB file that matches the build that’s
running on your server. You need this file to launch a debugging session.
3. A Symbol Server stores your PDB files and helps your debugger find the correct version.
If you have a Symbol Server in place, you can easily start a debugging session to
your server, and your debugger will find the correct PDB files automatically.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
228) You are discussing the reasons why you want to sign an assembly that you have built. The assembly will be distributed with a desktop application you are building. The assembly won’t be shared by other applications.

1. Should you sign the assembly?
If you want to increase security of the application you can sign the assembly and the application.
  
2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of signing?
Advantages of signing an assembly is that the security is increased, one disadvantages is that signed assemblies can only refer to signed assemblies,
this becomes a problem if you use a commercial library that is not signed.

Book answer:
1. Yes, you should sign the assembly.
2. Signing the assembly protects the assembly against tampering. The .NET Framework
will check that the assembly hasn’t been altered between signing and running.
3. Signing is also a requirement to be able to use a digital certificate so users of your application
will know that you are the publisher of the application.
4. A disadvantage could be that you can no longer reference other nonsigned assemblies.
If you own these assemblies, you can sign them yourself. If not, you would have
to ask their publisher to sign them.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
229) When should you plan the logging and tracing in your application?

At the start of application development and during application development.
Its more difficult to add logging and tracing after the application has finished.     

Book answer:
The logging and tracing elements of an application should be planned at the
very start of the design process. The more important a component is, the
more carefully you should consider how to determine the proper operation
of that component and the ease with which you can investigate failures.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
230) What is the difference between logging and tracing?

Logging is writting application info to file (persistence to file), tracing is writting application info to the console (No persistence to file).        

Book answer:
Logging is the production of output every time your program does
something interesting. For example, each time a bank application processes
a transaction, it can write an entry into a log file. Tracing is the production
of output that shows the path followed by the program. For example,
methods could generate messages when they are entered and when they are completed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
231) What is the difference between the Debug and Trace classes?

The Debug class is controlled by the #define DEBUG, the Trace class is controlled by the #define TRACE.
When creating a release version of the application the #define DEBUG is not defined, #define TRACE is by default defined in the release version (can be manually undefined).         

Book answer:
The Debug and Trace classes provide a similar set of behaviors. Both can be
used to generate events, and both support assertions and can support
listeners that receive the events they generate. The difference is that Debug
behaviors are not present in release builds, and the Trace class supports
levels of tracing output (information, warning and error) alongside simple messages.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
232) Does adding Debug and Trace elements to a program slow it down
appreciably? 

Yes, if you have a lot of Debug and Trace statements in the code, the execution of the program could slow down.
However when creating a release version of the application, the debug statements are removed.          

Book answer:
The Debug elements of a program are not active in an application when the
application is compiled in Release mode. However, the Trace elements will
always be performed when the program runs, although this may only take
the form of a single test to determine if a given TraceSource object has
any listeners assigned to it. The performance impact of inactive tracing is
trivial, compared with the benefits of having trace data in the event of problems.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
233) Do you have to modify the program to add tracing to it?

Yes, you need to add the Trace.WriteLine() statements to the code, and the #define TRACE needs to be defined. 

Book answer:
If you want to add tracing to a program that contains no trace code at all,
you will have to modify the program. However, you can create a program
that contains tracing elements that you can then control by modification of
the application configuration file. So, rather than modifying the application,
you can instead add a section to the application configuration file and even
create listeners and specify where their output is to be sent.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
234)What is the difference between the TraceSwitch and SourceSwitch classes?

TraceSwitch is a class that can be used as a flag. The TraceSwitch object value is checked in the code, depending on its value you can execute some specific code.
SourceSwitch is used to control the level of logging in the TraceSource class.      

Book answer:
The TraceSwitch class allows a program to create an object that a
program can use to control any tracing activities it may perform. The
program can set the required tracing level on the TraceSwitch instance,
and then test the instance to decide what tracing output to produce. The
SourceSwitch class is used with the TraceSource class to specify the
level of tracing to be produced by a TraceSource instance.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
235) Where does the program store its performance counter information?

The value of a performance counter is managed by the OS.  

Book answer:
A program doesn’t have to store any of the performance counter information
that it works with. Performance counters are managed by the operating
system on the computer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
236) What is a log event? 

Interesting application events can be logged on the operating system in the Event Log, you can view the Event Log using the Event Viewer.
An application can register for a log event in which it is interested in (with the specified source), when an message is written
to the EventLog (with the specified source), the log event is fired and subscribers are notified.         

Book answer:
A log event is a packet of data that describes a particular event. It will
typically contain the date and time the event occurred, an event status, and
some text.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
237) A fellow programmer is complaining that their program is not creating and
updating its performance counters. Can you think of any reason why this
would happen?

It could be that the application does not have sufficient permissions, administrator privileges.

Book answer:
A program is only permitted to create performance counters and log events
if it is running with Administrator permissions. It might be that the failing
program is not running with these permissions enabled.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
238) Does the operating system generate events when performance counter values
are updated?

No, because the only event in the EventLog class is EventLog.EntryWritten event.

Book answer:
A “dashboard” application can read performance counters that are set by the
system being monitored. It can also read event log entries produced by the
system, and also binds to log events so that the dashboard display can be
updated as the status of the application changes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
239)How could an application monitor the amount of free memory that is
available as the application runs? 

You can add a PerformanceCounter that monitors the available memory. 

Book answer:
An application can read the appropriate performance counter. There are
several that deal with memory use.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
240) Why can’t a program create an instance of the Stream type?

The Stream class is an abstract class hence you cannot create an instance of the type. 

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
241) When would a program modify the file pointer in a file?

When you for example want to append text to a file (SeekOrigin.End). 

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
242) What is the difference between UT8 Unicode and UTF32 Unicode?

UTF-8 is a variable-width encoding UTF-32 is a fixed-length encoding. 
UTF-8 is a clever way of encoding Unicode text. Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit is a variable-width encoding that can represent every character in the Unicode character set. 
It was designed for backward compatibility with ASCII and to avoid the complications of endianness and byte order marks in UTF-16 and UTF-32.
UTF-32 is a fixed-length encoding used to encode Unicode code points that uses exactly 32 bits (four bytes) per code point.

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
243) Is there such a thing as a “text file?”

“text files” contain bytes with can be mapped to character symbols.

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
244) Can a program both read from and write to a single file?

Yes, for example you can write to a file and then rewind the file pointer and read back the info that was written to it.     

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
245) What is the difference between a TextWriter and a StreamWriter?

TextWriter is an abstract class that makes it easier to write text to a file, StreamWriter derives from TextWriter and can be used to write
text to files.      

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
246) Why is it useful for a stream class to have a constructor that accepts an
object of the stream type?

In this way you can chain streams together. 


Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
247) What is the File class for?

Static class can be used to process a file, set file attributes, read file content etc.    

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
248)Will you need to re-compile a program for it to be used on a system with a
different file system?

No the MSIL code generated is machine independent, the JIT 
(Just in time compiler) will generate the correct machinecode for the platform.  
The FileStream object provides a stream instance connected to a file. The
stream object instance converts calls into the stream into commands for the
filesystem on the computer running the program. The file system provides the
interface to the physical device performing the data storage for the computer.
A call of the Write method in a stream object will generate a request to 
the file system to write the data to the storage device.

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
249) What happens to the files in a directory when you delete the directory?

If you use c# calls to delete a directory containing files an exception is thrown.   
If you are able to delete a directory file, the files in it would not be accessible anymore, 
because the directory file contains the location to the files in it.  

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
250)How can you tell if a file path is an absolute path to the file?

If a path does not contain dots ".", it is an absolute path to the file. 
An absolute path includes the drive letter and identifies all the sub-directories
in the path to the file.

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
251) Why should you use the Path class to construct file paths in your
programs?

The Path class contains method that easily let you manipulate a filepath,
for example you can easily extract the directory, filename, extension from a filepath.     

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
252) What is the difference between HTTP and HTML?

HTTP is the protocol that transfers HTML information from the server to the client which is then renderd to a webpage by the browser.     

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
253) When should you use the HttpWebRequest class to contact a web
server?

When you want flexibility in your request, you can configure a lot of parameters in the HttpWebRequest object.    

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
254) Can a program make web requests asynchronously?

Yes

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
255) Why is it a good idea to perform file operations asynchronously?

File access is a very slow activity when compared with the speed of modern processors.
Therefore you dont want a thread to synchonously wait for the file IO to complete,
you dont want to bind your thread when it can do other CPU bound work such as updating the UI/progressbar.

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
256) Does each user of a database need their own copy of the data?

No, if you use a database in an application you can use transactions to commit a range of changes in an atomic operation.
After the commit of the transaction, the changes will be visible to other database clients.        

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
257) What would happen if two users of a database updated the same record at the same time? 

You would then have a lost update, the last update will be written to the database, the other will be lost.  
To avoid this, each record/row in the database should have a "Last Modified Date" column which keeps track when the row was last modified.      
When you want to update a record that was read from the database you should make sure that last modified date in the record is the same as when
the record was read, as illustrated next.    

UPDATE TableName SET Columname=@Columname WHERE ID=@ID AND LastModifiedDate=@LastModifiedDate   

Note: The last modified date should be updated by a database trigger when the record/row is modified.     

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
258) What would happen if two items in a database had the same ID value?

If the ID is the primary key, you would not be able to uniquely identify rows. 
The database management engine will not allow you to insert records with primary keys that already exist in the table, an error is thrown when an attempt is made.  

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
259) Why do you need to protect your database connection string?

It contains sensitive information on how to connect with the Database, this information can be abused by malicious users to connect with the database.  

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
260) Do you always have to write SQL queries to interact with a database?

No, if you for example use entity framework, the framework has methods which allow you to query the databse.
_dbContext.Update(record), _dbContext.Add(record), _dbContext.Delete(record).
Furthermore you can use LINQ to query the database in entity framework.     

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
261) What is an SQL injection attack, and how do you protect against one?

If you directly construct queries from user input, malicious users can enter additional query commands to abuse the database.     
You can protect this against SQL injection attack by using parametrized SQLCommands.  

SQLCommand cmd = new SQLCommand("Select *from TableName WHERE FieldName=@FieldName", connection);  
cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(@FieldName, "Value");

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
262) You can see how to read JSON data from a server, but is it possible to store
JSON formatted data values on a server?

Yes, you can serialize an object (JsonConvert.Serialize()), and then send the JSON formatted string to a server using a WebRequest object.   

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
263)What is the difference between a web service and just downloading JSON
document from a server?

In order to call a web service, you need to create a web service client. 
If you want to download a JSON document from a server, you can just use a webclient to download the JSON string.       

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
264) What does “Language INtegrated Query” actually mean?

Query capabilities in the c# language similar to SQL, the LINQ capabilities can be used to query databases and c# collections.        

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
265) Does LINQ add new features for data manipulation?

Yes, you can use LINQ syntax to query collections similar to SQL language. 
Note you can iterate and filter collections using LINQ methods and loops.    

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
266) Is it more efficient to build and perform our own SQL queries than to use
LINQ?

When querying a database using LINQ, the LINQ query is converted in an SQL query.
Therefore if you use SQL syntax its is more efficient because the library (such as entity framework) does not need to convert LINQ syntax into SQL syntax.      

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
267) Why would the statement var counter; cause a compilation error?

Because the compiler cannot infer the type of counter.   

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
268) What is an anonymous type?

Anonymous type, as the name suggests, is a type that doesn't have any name. C# allows you to create an object with the 
new keyword without defining its class. The implicitly typed variable- var is used to hold the reference of anonymous types       

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
269) What does “deferred execution” of a LINQ query mean?

It means that the LINQ query is not executed until the information in the defined query is requested or you call the ToArray()/ToList() method.     

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
270) What does the group behavior do in a LINQ query?

It groups data, you can for example use aggregation functions to calculate sums, averages on collections.  

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
271) What do the take and skip behaviors do?

When you use paging you can use take and skip functions to move through the collection, 
for example you can display ten entries from the collection in a webpage, 
each time you go to the next page new entries are retrieved using the take and skip functions.          

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
272) What is the difference between query comprehension and method-based
LINQ queries?

Query comprehension uses LINQ syntax which is converted by the CLR to method-based
LINQ queries.  

Example of Query comprehension: var result = from track in tracks where track.Name == "Rob" select track;  
Example of method-based LINQ queries: var result = tracks.where(track => track.Name == "Rob"); 

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
273) What is the difference between the XDocument and XElement types?

XDocument represents a complete XML document, the XElement represents an XML node in the XML document.   

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
274) What is the difference between the XmlDocument and XDocument
types?

XDocument is the newer version of XmlDocument (XML processing class), 
one advantage of XDocument is that it can be used with LINQ syntax.     

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
275) When should you use serialization in your program?

When you want to store or transfer structured data, for example you want to persist the state of an application and its objects. 

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
276) Do you need a copy of the type to read a serialized object? 

When you use BinaryFormatter to serialize an object, the data of the object is written to file without type information.
When you want to deserialize data from file, you need to know the type of the object in the binary data in order to map the data.
When you use XML/JSON serializer you can see the data type in the file. 

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
277) Can any data type be serialized?

Yes, binary date can be writen to file and read back (You can use Base64 encoding when writing data so that serialization data is readable)

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
278)Can value types and reference types be stored using serialization?

Yes, although serialization of reference types using XmlSerialization can lead to duplicate objects instead of multiple objects referencing one object.       

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
279) Does serialization store all of the elements of a class?

Depending on the serialization method, private members could be excluded by certain serializers, furthermore you can excluded 
properties with the NonSerializable attribute.

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
280) When should you use binary serialization and when should you use XML
serialization?

When you have different objects that share the same objects, you need to use binary serialization because
if you use XML serialization the shared object will be created many time instead of just one shared object.     


Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
281) Why should you be concerned about security when using binary
serialization?

Data serialized to file can be manipulated by malicious actors, when you deserialize the data
in the file, you create objects that have manipulated data that could impact the security of the application process and working conditions.         

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
282) Can you use a custom serializer when serializing to an XML document?

Yes, using the [OnSerializing], [OnSerialized], [OnDeserializing], [OnDeserialized] attributes to decorate methods.
In these methods you can add custom code. 

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
283) Is it possible to encrypt a serialized class?

Yes you can encrypt a serialized object, for example when you implement the ISerializable interface,
you can add encryption in the GetObject(SerializationInfo info,  SerializationContext context) method before the data is written to file,
when the data is deserialized in the constructor(SerializationInfo info,  SerializationContext context), the data is decrypted.         

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
284)What is the difference between an XML serializer and a DataContract
serializer?

When using DataContract serializer you need to decorate each property with the [DataMember] in order to serialize the properties.
Furthermore you can serialize private properties which you cant using XML serializer.      


Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
285) When should you use a collection, and when should you use a database?

When you want to persist data you should use a database, otherwise you can use collections to store data in.
Furthermore if you want to share your data with other application clients without creating addtitional infrastructure.     
A single SQL database server can provide data storage to be shared between a large number of clients.
Finally data in a database can be easily an faster(using indexed columns) searched through by executing generic queries constructed from user input.   

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
286) Can you create an array of arrays? 

Yes, arrays of arrays are called jagged arrays.

string[][] wordList = new string[][]
{
	new string[] { "Dog", "Cat", "Bird"},
	new string[] { "House", "Street" },
	new string[] { "skyscraper" }
};

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
287) Can you create a twenty-dimensional array?

Yes, there is no limit on how many dimensions an array can be.  
An example of a two dimensional array is shown below.

int [,] matrix = new int[,] //Note declaration could also be [4,5] 
{
	{ 0, 45, 4, 12, 16 }, 
	{ 7, 34, 7, 11, 19 },
	{ 54, 87, 32, 68, 123 },
	{ 45, 32, 19, 23, 45 }
};

int rows = matrix.GetLength(0);
int columns = matrix.GetLength(1);

for(int rowCount = 0; rowCount < rows; rowCount++)
{
	for(int columnCount = 0; columnCount < columns; columnCount++)
	{
		Console.Write("{0}{1}", matrix[rowCount, columnCount],
			columnCount == (columns - 1) ? "\n" : " ");
	}
}

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
288) Why does the program keep crashing with an array index error?

The program wants to access memory beyond the boundry of the array. When this happens an IndexOutOfRangeException is thrown.  
The programmer should fix the indexing used to access the array.   

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
289) The array is one element too small. How do you add a new element on the
end of the array?

An array cannot dynamically be resized, therefore you need to create a new array and copy the elements from the original 
array to the new array as shown below.   

/// <summary>
/// Resizes an array.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="source">Source array of type T that needs to be resized.</param>
/// <param name="newSize">The requested new array size.</param>
/// <returns>void.</returns>
private void ResizeArray<T>(ref T[] source, int newSize)
{
	if (source == null)
		throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(source));

	if (source.Length > newSize)
		throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("Source array is larger than requested array, choose right size.");

	T[] buffer = new T[newSize];
	source.CopyTo(buffer, 0);
	source = buffer; //Array is passed by refrence so we can assign it a new array/memory address  
}

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
290) Why do you use Length to get the length of an array and Count to get the
number of items in an ArrayList?

An array is allocated as one block of memory you can therfore use length to determine the array size.
An ArrayList behaves as a linked list, every time you add a new element to the list new memory is allocated and pointers are set to
reference the new memory allocated. In order to determine the list count, the arraylist needs to iterate through the linked list.        
Hence you use Count to determine the number of objects in the ArrayList and you use length to determine the array size.    

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
291) How does a Dictionary actually work?

The Dictionary class probably uses a list or array of keyvaluepair in an indexed class, as illustrated in the code below. 

public class SimpleDictionary<TKey,TValue>
{
	private KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>[] buffer = new KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>[defaultCapacity];
	public void Add(TKey key, TValue value) {};
	public bool Remove(TKey key) {};
	public TValue this[TKey key] { get{} set{} }; //Class Indexer
}

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
292) When would you use a set?

The HashSet<T> class provides high-performance set operations. A set is a collection that contains no duplicate elements, and whose elements are in no particular order.
When you easily want to compare collections with each other you can use HashSet<T>, for example it provides the IsSubsetOf(IEnumerable<T>) method
which determines whether a HashSet<T> object is a subset of the specified collection.

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
293) What is the difference between a stack and a queue?

A Stack<T> stores objects in a LIFO way (Last In First Out), a Queue stores items in a FIFO way (First In First Out) 

Book answer:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
294) Could you use a List to store every type of data in my program?

Yes if you define the list as a collection of objects similar to ArrayList.
All types in C# derive from object, hence all types can be stored in an object list (List<object>) 

List<object> list = new List<object>();
list.Add("The brown fox");
list.Add(2020);
list.Add(new ArrayList() { "Dog", "Wolf" });
list.Add(new int[] { 2000, 2020, 2030, 2050 });
foreach (object item in list)
{
	Console.WriteLine("{0}", item.GetType());
	if (item.GetType() == typeof(string))
	{
		string str = (string)item;
		Console.WriteLine("String: {0}", str);
	}

	if (item.GetType() == typeof(int))
	{
		int number = (int)item;
		Console.WriteLine("Int: {0}", number);
	}

	if (item.GetType() == typeof(ArrayList))
	{
		ArrayList arrayList = (ArrayList)item;
		Console.WriteLine("ArrayList: {0}, {1}", (string)arrayList[0], (string)arrayList[1]);
	}

	if (item.GetType() == typeof(int[]))
	{
		int[] arr = (int[])item;
		Console.WriteLine("int[]: {0}, {1}, {2}, {3}", arr[0], arr[1], arr[2], arr[3]);
	}
}

295)An application includes a class named Person. The Person class includes a method named GetData.
You need to ensure that the GetData() from the Person class can only be called by derived classes. 
Which access modifier should you use for the GetData() method?

A. Internal
B. Protected
C. Private
D. Protected internal
E. Public

B, Protected method can only be called from the class itself and from derived classes.

Book answer: B
Protected - The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class, or in a class that is derived from that class.
The protected keyword is a member access modifier. A protected member is accessible within its class and by derived class instances.
Reference: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173121.aspx 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
296)You are implementing a method named Calculate that performs conversions between value types and reference types. The following code segment implements
the method. (Line numbers are included for reference only.)

private void calculate(float price)
{
	object boxedValue = price;
	????????????????????????????
	Console.WriteLine("Price: {0}", balance);
}

You need to ensure that the application does not throw exceptions on invalid conversions. Which code segment should you insert at line with the questionmark?

A. int balance = (int) (float)boxedValue;
B. int balance = (int)boxedValue;
C. int balance = boxedValue;
D. int balance = (int) (double) boxedValue;

A, you first need to unbox the float value and then perform an explict conversion to int.
Note the decimal part of the float is discarded, to avoid this you can add 0.5, like this:
int balance = (int) ((float)boxedValue + 0.5) 

Book answer: A
Explicit cast of object into float, and then another Explicit cast of float into int. Reference: explicit (C# Reference)

302) You are developing an application. The application contains the following code segment (line numbers are included for reference only):

01 ArrayList arrayList1 = new ArrayList();
02 int var1 = 10, var2;
03 arrayList1.Add(var1);
04 var2 = arrayList1[0];
05 Console.WriteLine("{0}", var2);

When you run the code, you receive the following error message: "Cannot implicitly convert type 'object'' to 'inf. An explicit conversion exists (are you missing a
cast?)."
You need to ensure that the code can be compiled. Which code should you use to replace line 04?
A. var2 = ((List<int>) array1) [0];
B. var2 = array1[0].Equals(typeof(int));
C. var2 = Convert.ToInt32(array1[0]);

303)You are developing an application that includes a method named SendMessage.
You need to ensure that the SendMessage() method is called with the required parameters. Which two code segments can you use to achieve this goal? (Each
correct answer presents a complete solution. Choose two.)

A)	static void main(string[] args)
	{
		dynamic obj = new { From = "John Morris", To = "Jane Smith", Content = "Message to you." };
		SendMessage(obj);
	}

	private void SendMessage(object msg)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("{0}", msg.From);
		Console.WriteLine("{0}", msg.To);
		Console.WriteLine("{0}", msg.Content);
	}

B)	static void main(string[] args)
	{
		var obj = new object();
		obj.From = "John Morris";
		obj.To = "Jane Smith";
		obj.Content = "Message to you.";
		SendMessage(obj);
	}

	private void SendMessage(dynamic msg)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("{0}", msg.From);
		Console.WriteLine("{0}", msg.To);
		Console.WriteLine("{0}", msg.Content);
	}

//Anonymous type
C)	static void main(string[] args)
	{
		var obj = new { From = "John Morris", To = "Jane Smith", Content = "Message to you." };
		SendMessage(obj);
	}

	private void SendMessage(dynamic msg)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("{0}", msg.From);
		Console.WriteLine("{0}", msg.To);
		Console.WriteLine("{0}", msg.Content);
	}

//ExpandoObject
D)	static void main(string[] args)
	{
		var obj = new ExpandoObject();
		obj.From = "John Morris";
		obj.To = "Jane Smith";
		obj.Content = "Message to you.";
		SendMessage(obj);
	}

	private void SendMessage(dynamic msg)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("{0}", msg.From);
		Console.WriteLine("{0}", msg.To);
		Console.WriteLine("{0}", msg.Content);
	}

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

CD

Book answer:CD
C: is Anonymous type
D: ExpandoObject
Represents an object whose members can be dynamically added and removed at run time.
/ The ExpandoObject class enables you to add and delete members of its instances at run time and also to set and get values of these members. This class
supports dynamic binding, which enables you to use standard syntax like sampleObject.sampleMember instead of more complex syntax like
sampleObject.GetAttribute("sampleMember").
/ You can pass instances of the ExpandoObject class as parameters. Note that these instances are treated as dynamic objects in C# and late-bound objects in
Visual Basic. This means that you do not have IntelliSense for object members and you do not receive compiler errors when you call nonexistent members. If you
call a member that does not exist, an exception occurs.
Incorrect:
Not A, not B: It tries to get/set From, to properties of type Object. It does not compile.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
304) You write the following method (line numbers are included for reference only):
        
private List<string> IsWebsite(string url)
{
	const string pattern = @"https://(www\.)?([^\.])+\.com";
	List<string> results = new List<string>();

	MatchCollection matches = Regex.Matches(url, pattern);
	????????????????????????????????
	return results;
}

You need to ensure that the method extracts a list of URLs that match the following pattern:
@http://(www\.)?([^\.]+)\.com;
Which code should you insert at line with the questionmarks?

A)	foreach (Match match in matches)
		results.Add(match.Groups.ToString());

B)	results = (List<string>)matches.GetEnumerator();

C)	foreach (Match match in matches)
		results.Add(match.Value);

D)	results = (List<string>)matches.SynRoot;

A. Option A
B. Option B
C. Option C
D. Option D

C, each match is added to the list.

Book answer: C
* MatchCollection
Represents the set of successful matches found by iteratively applying a regular expression pattern to the input string.
The collection is immutable (read-only) and has no public constructor. The Regex.Matches method returns a MatchCollection object.
* List<T>.Add Method Adds an object to the end of the List<T>. Incorrect:
Not A: Gives groups array. Hence Tostring(0 method mentioned above won’t give desird result Not D: ICollection.SyncRoot Property
For collections whose underlying store is not publicly available, the expected implementation is to return the current instance. Note that the pointer to the current
instance might not be sufficient for collections that wrap other collections; those should return the underlying collection's SyncRoot property.

305) You need to write a method that combines an unknown number of strings. The solution must minimize the amount of memory used by the method when the
method executes. What should you include in the code?

A. The String.Concat method
B. The StringBuilder.Append method
C. The + operator
D. The += operator

B, StringBuilder uses character array and hence does not need to create new immutable string objects when combining strings  

Book answer:B
StringBuilder is the best method when there are an unknown number of strings. Incorrect:
Not A: Compared to the StringBuilder.Append method, the String.Concat method uses more resources.
String concatenation creates a new string, needing more memory, and is generally considered slow. Not D: += is not used to append strings.

	{ "Operations", 3 }
};

private bool? FindInList(string searchTerm, int value)
{
	return dictionary.Contains(new KeyValuePair<string, int>(searchTerm, value));
}

1)	bool? isInList = FindInList("Finance", 0);
	Console.WriteLine("Dictionary(Finance, 0) is in list: [{0}]", isInList == null ? "null" : isInList.ToString());

2)	isInList = FindInList("Accounting", 2);
	Console.WriteLine("Dictionary(Accounting, 2) is in list: [{0}]", isInList == null ? "null" : isInList.ToString());

3)	isInList = FindInList("Accounting", 1);
	Console.WriteLine("Dictionary(Accounting, 1) is in list: [{0}]", isInList == null ? "null" : isInList.ToString());

Entry 1) bool? isInList = FindInList("Finance", 0);, returns false; 

Entry 2) isInList = FindInList("Accounting", 2);, returns false;
 
Entry 3) isInList = FindInList("Accounting", 1);, returns true;

309) You are developing code for a class named Account. The Account class includes the
following method:

private int cents = 0;
private int dollars = 0;

public void Deposit(int dollars, int cents)
{
	int totalCents = cents + this.cents;
	int extraDollars = totalCents / 100;
	this.cents = totalCents - 100 * extraDollars;
	this.dollars += dollars + extraDollars;
}

You need to ensure that overflow exceptions are thrown when there is an error.
Which type of block should you use?

Option A) checked

Option B) try

Option C) using

Option D) unchecked

A, you need to enclose the code in a checked block

private int cents = 0;
private int dollars = 0;

public void Deposit(int dollars, int cents)
{
	checked
	{
		int totalCents = cents + this.cents;
		int extraDollars = totalCents / 100;
		this.cents = totalCents - 100 * extraDollars;
		this.dollars += dollars + extraDollars; 
	}
}

You can then call the method from a try catch block as shown below:

try 
{
	Deposit(1000, 1010);
	Console.WriteLine("Dollars: {0}, cents: {1}", dollars, cents);
	Deposit(int.MaxValue, 10);
}
catch (System.OverflowException e)
{
	// The following line displays information about the error.
	Console.WriteLine("OverflowException CHECKED and CAUGHT:  " + e.ToString());

310) You are developing an application in C#.
The application will display the temperature and the time at which the temperature was
recorded. You have the following method (line numbers are included for reference only):

private void DisplayTemerature(DateTime date, double temp)
{
	string output;
?	output = string.Format("Temperature at TARGET1 on TARGET2 is TARGET3 degrees celsius.", date, temp);
	Console.WriteLine("{0}", output);
}


You need to ensure that the message displayed in the lblMessage object shows the time
formatted according to the following requirements:
The time must be formatted as hour:minute AM/PM, for example 2:00 PM.
The date must be formatted as month/day/year, for example 04/21/2013.
The temperature must be formatted to have two decimal places, for example 23.45.
Which code should you insert at line with the Question marks? (To answer, select the appropriate options for each TARGET in the answer area.)

TARGET1 should be:
A) {0:h:mm tt}
B) {1:h:mm tt}
C) {0:t} 
D) {1:t}

TARGET2 should be:
A) {0:MM/dd/yyyy}
B) {1:MM/dd/yyyy}
C) {0:d} 
D) {1:d}

TARGET3 should be:
A) {1:N2}
B) {0:N2}
C) {1)
D) {0)

The following code produces the correct output:
Temperature at 2:00 PM on 04/21/2013 is 23.45 degrees celsius.
Note MM is used for months while mm is used for minutes in the data notation 
 
private void DisplayTemerature(DateTime date, double temp)
{
	string output;
	output = string.Format("Temperature at {0:h:mm tt} on {0:MM/dd/yyyy} is {1:N2} degrees celsius.", date, temp);
	Console.WriteLine("{0}", output);
