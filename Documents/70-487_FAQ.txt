11) Contoso has several applications that currently use ADO.NET to interact with the
database. Each application used to run locally inside the corporate network. Now,
there’s tremendous pressure to expose many of them to the outside world. You’re
tasked with deciding whether ADO.NET should continue to be used or whether
a move should be made to another technology. If a move away from ADO.NET is
made, you need to decide which other technology should be used.

With this in mind, answer the following questions:

1. Should you continue building applications with ADO.NET?
Yes, it is a proven technology that continues to be supported.  
ADO.NET has been around the longest and has several advantages. It does not require
persistent connections to the underlying data store, enables you to access virtually
all major database implementations, and enables you to access data through custom
objects or through objects specifically suited to the tasks at hand (DataSet and
DataTable).

If you continue to build using ADO.NET, meeting application requirements will be increasingly
difficult. It would provide consistency, but any functionality that needs to be
exposed to the outside world will take more and more effort (arguably wasted effort
to accomplish).

2. Does using the EF provide any benefit toward the stated goal that ADO.NET doesn’t?
When using EF you can focus on using entities in the application instead of using sql
to query data and populate entities using the retrieved data.   
By using the EF, developers can focus on the conceptual model (solving business logic
and dealing with business issues) without being overly concerned with the underlying
data store. EF is specifically focused on working with an entity, but not quite as much
as working with bulk data all at once. 

In and of itself, the EF doesn’t get you closer to the goal, but it would enable easier
interoperability with WCF Data Services, for instance. It would set the groundwork for
moving to OData.

3. Would WCF Data Services provide any benefit toward the stated goal that ADO. NET doesn’t?
ADO. NET cannot provide the same easy data access to the the outside world as WCF Data Services do.
WCF Data Services let your applications provide universal data access. The consumption
of WCF Data Services is not tied to any proprietary technology, so can be
consumed by both Microsoft and non-Microsoft technologies. WCF Data Services are
meant to be used in conjunction with the EF on the back end. They provide a very
fast and easy way to build applications and make the data easily accessible to any
consumer.

Moving legacy applications to WCF Data Services would not be trivial. They are already
built and tested. However, moving them so they could be consumed externally will
require changes, no matter how it is accomplished. WCF Data Services would allow for
all the required features that don’t currently exist.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12) You are building an ADO.NET EF application. You need to add a property of type
NVARCHAR(50) named Notes to the underlying database table named Customer and
have it reflected in the Customer entity. What should you do?

A. Drop the Customer table and re-create it with the new field; then choose the
Generate Database From Model option.
B. Add the field to the underlying table, add a Scalar property of type String to the
Customer entity, and update the mapping.
C. Run the Update Model Wizard.
D. Run the EDM Generator.

C

Correct answers: A, B, C, D
A. Correct: This is technically correct, but dropping the table means that all the data
goes with it. That could work in some development environments, but in production
it is a terrible idea. Because the environment wasn’t mentioned, this is still a
correct answer.
B. Correct: This would update the entity and the data source correctly.
C. Correct: This would update the entity and the data source correctly.
D. Correct: This would update the entity and the data source correctly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13) You have been asked to choose a data access technology to retrieve data from a SQL
Server database and have it exposed over the web. The application will be consumed
exclusively by external parties that have no access to the internal database. Which data
access technologies should you recommend? (Choose all that apply.)

A. LINQ-to-SQL
B. ADO.NET Entity Framework
C. WCF Data Services
D. ADO.NET Data Services

C

Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: LINQ-to-SQL will facilitate data access, but does nothing to expose the
data to the web.
B. Incorrect: The EF will facilitate data access, but does nothing to expose the data to
the web.
C. Correct: This would enables you to meet all the data requirements as well as the
transmission requirements.
D. Incorrect: This technology no longer exists.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14) You are working with an EDM and suspect there’s a problem with the mappings. Which
file should you look at to see the underlying code?

A. CSDL file
B. SSDL file
C. MSL file
D. EDMX file

D

The conceptual model is handled via what’s known as the conceptual schema definition
language (CSDL). In older versions of EF, it existed in a file with a .csdl extension. The data
storage aspect is handled through the store schema definition language (SSDL). In older versions
of EF, it existed in a file with an .ssdl file extension. The mapping between the CSDL
and SSDL is handled via the mapping specification language (MSL). In older versions of EF, it
existed in a file with an .msl file extension. In modern versions of EF, the CSDL, MSL, and SSDL
all exist in a file with an .edmx file extension. However, even though all three are in a single
file, it is important to understand the differences between the three.

Correct answer: D
A. Incorrect: This file technically no longer exists, so wouldn’t be appropriate.
B. Incorrect: This file technically no longer exists, so wouldn’t be appropriate.
C. Incorrect: This file technically no longer exists, so wouldn’t be appropriate.
D. Correct: Each of the preexisting files, including the mapping files, is included here.

15) Contoso has determined that its primary database is experiencing tremendous traffic
volumes. Upon analysis, it determines that much of the traffic is around identical requests.

With this in mind, answer the following questions:

1. What type of data would you consider as a candidate for caching?
Serializable and binary(such as movies, bin files) data that are frequently requested 
and does not change that often.   

The more static and less volatile it is, the better the candidate is for caching.

2. What factors would you consider when determining a caching strategy?
Determine which data in the application is frequently requested.
Determine if data caching does not result in unaccaptable "old" data,
for example patient data in hospital needs to be the most recent data 
and not the cached data from a few hours ago.         

How frequent repeat trips are to the source coupled with the size of it. At some point,
reducing trips to the database can be offset by size of the data. Local storage or cache
storage sizes can be burdensome, so caching isn’t a magic bullet.

3. What would you contemplate regarding data changes?
You can use ChangeMonitors to monitor the underlying data that is cached,
if the source data is changed, invalidate the cache, 
after which the cache data can be refreshed

The more frequently data changes, the less likely it is to be a viable candidate for caching.
Monitoring is not inexpensive, and although very helpful in some cases, it would
offset the benefit of caching. In the same respect, if the expiration policy is very small,
the benefit of caching is diminished. If monitoring needs to happen in most cases,
any benefit from caching will be greatly reduced, and a scenario could arise in which
things are much worse because of it. Such scenarios are atypical and usually arise from
overuse, but they do happen.     
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16) Which of the following are provided for use by the .NET Framework as ChangeMonitors when defining a CacheItemPolicy? (Choose all that apply.)

A. CacheEntryChangeMonitor
B. FileChangeMonitor
C. MsmqChangeMonitor
D. SqlChangeMonitor

ABD 

Correct answers: A, B, D
A. Correct: CacheEntryChangeMonitor is a valid option.
B. Correct: FileChangeMonitor is a valid option.
C. Incorrect: There is no such thing as an MsmqChangeMonitor.
D. Correct: SqlChangeMonitor is a valid option.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17) Which values are valid choices when defining the Priority property of the CacheItemPolicy using the System.Runtime.Caching version of the Cache? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Normal
B. High
C. NotRemovable
D. Low

C

Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: The System.Runtime.Caching.CacheItemPriority enum does not have
a Normal option. It does exist, however, in the System.Web.Caching.CacheItem
Priority enum.
B. Incorrect: The System.Runtime.Caching.CacheItemPriority enum does not
have a High option. It does exist, however, in the System.Web.Caching.
CacheItemPriority enum.
C. Correct: There is a NotRemovable option.
D. Incorrect: The System.Runtime.Caching.CacheItemPriority enum does
not have a Low option. It does exist, however, in the System.Web.Caching.
CacheItemPriority enum.

18)You have set up an ObjectCache instance using the following code:

List<String> fileList = new List<String>();
fileList.Add(@"C:\SomeDirectory\SampleFile.txt");
ObjectCache cacheInstance = MemoryCache.Default;
CacheItemPolicy accountPolicy = new CacheItemPolicy();
accountPolicy.Priority = CacheItemPriority.Default;
accountPolicy.AbsoluteExpiration = DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(60);
accountPolicy.ChangeMonitors.Add(new HostFileChangeMonitor(fileList));
CacheItem exampleItem1 = new CacheItem("ExampleItemId", "Example Item Value", "AccountObjects");

Which of the following items add an item to the cache with a key named “ExampleItemId,” a value of “Example Item Value,” 
a region named “AccountObjects,” and a CacheItemPolicy with a Default CacheItemPriority? (Choose all that apply.)

A. cacheInstance.Add(exampleItem1, accountPolicy);
B. cacheInstance.Add(exampleItem1, accountPolicy.Priority.Default);
C. cacheInstance.Add(“ExampleItemId”, “Example Item Value”, accountPolicy);
D. cacheInstance.Add(“ExampleItemId”, “Example Item Value”, accountPolicy, “AccountObjects”);

AD

Correct answers: A, D
A. Correct: This would accomplish the requirements.
B. Incorrect: The second parameter cannot be a CacheItemPriority. It will not
compile.
C. Incorrect: This does not set the Region name.
D. Correct: This would accomplish the requirements.

19) Contoso has several mission-critical processes that are starting to cause problems.
Users are reporting increasingly frequent processing errors. Additionally, there are
several problems with partial or incomplete records being created. For instance,
users are receiving Order Processing Failure messages and then getting tracking
numbers for their order.

With this in mind, answer the following questions:
1. What would make an operation a good candidate for a transaction?
If an operation contains multiple database action that all must complete correctly,
in case one operation fails, all operations must be rolledback.     
Transactions serve to make database interactions all-or-nothing propositions. Once
executed, they need to complete successfully, or they need to be completely undone and
leave things exactly as they were had the change attempt not been made if they failed.

Clearly defined boundaries are the main consideration. The more items affected in a
transaction and the longer an operation takes, the more problems you’ll see related to
making it transactional.

2. Why not make every operation transactional?
It does not make sense to make each operation transactional, if one operation fails, it already means it 
is not entered in the database. Transactions only make sense if you have multiple database operations      
that all need to succeed or be rollbacked completely.

There are several costs associated with implementing transactions, and these costs can
add up quickly. If every operation were transactional, it would add tremendous cost
without necessary benefit.

3. What considerations would guide the choice of transaction implementation?
Operations that encompass data modification in multiple database tables.
The operations must completely succeed or rollback completely.   

The importance of the data is one main consideration. How long-running the process
is would be another consideration. The number of resources affected would be
another one.

20)You are developing an ASP.NET application that reads data from and writes data to a
SQL Server database. You should avoid nonrepeatable reads and not concern yourself
with phantom data. Which isolation level should you use?

A. ReadUncommitted
B. RepeatableRead
C. Chaos
D. Snapshot

D

Correct answers: B, D
A. Incorrect: ReadUncommitted would result in nonrepeatable reads.
B. Correct: RepeatableRead would be the loosest IsolationLevel that would meet
these requirements.
C. Incorrect: Chaos does not work with SQL Server.
D. Correct: Snapshot would meet these requirements but might be overkill.

A non-repeatable read is one in which data read twice inside the same transaction cannot be guaranteed to contain the same value. 
Depending on the isolation level, another transaction could have nipped in and updated the value between the two reads.
Non-repeatable reads occur because at lower isolation levels reading data only locks the data for the duration of the read, 
rather than for the duration of the transaction. Sometimes this behavior might be completely desirable. Some applications may 
want to know the absolute, real-time value, even mid transaction, whereas other types of transactions might need to read the same value multiple times.

RepeatableRead:
Locks are placed on all data used in the query, which completely prevents others from updating any data covered by the lock. 
It stops nonrepeatable reads, but the phantom data problem is still possible.

Snapshot:
An effective copy of the data is made, so one version of the application can read
the data while another is modifying the same data. You can’t see data from one 
transaction in another one, even if you run the query again. The size of them can also cause problems if overused.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21) Which items would benefit from being made transactional?

A. Long-running queries that span multiple tables
B. Quick-running queries that involve only one table
C. Queries that make use of the file system on a Windows operating system.
D. Queries that make use of the file system of a non-Windows operating system.

A

Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: Long running operations that span several tables may necessitate transactional
support, but the duration and complexity would generally pose serious
locking and contention issues.
B. Correct: Small fast operations are generally the best candidates for transactions.
C. Incorrect: Operations that involve the file system would generally be problematic
and would not benefit from transactions.
D. Incorrect: A non-Windows operating system would present many problems and
would not be a good candidate for transactional support.

22) Your company is looking to move its core applications to the cloud. You have two
primary applications: one that hosts video training files and another that provides
advanced statistics about user interaction patterns. All the consumers of the application
are currently clustered around three major metropolitan U.S. cities.
With these items in mind, answer the following questions:

1. What storage options would you consider for each of the two scenarios?
Use Blob(Block or Page) storage to store video training files.
Use SQL Azure or Table storage to store user interaction patterns. 

Blog storage for the video and table storage for the statistical information would probably
be best here.
 
2. Would one storage option suffice or would you want more than one?
I would use two storage options, Blob storage and SQL Azure or Table storage.   

It might be possible to use just one approach. However, although you could use Blob
storage to store the statistical information, you couldn’t use table storage for the media
files in any practical sense.

3. Would this be a good candidate for the CDN? Why or why not?
Video training files are not often updated/changed, so they could be cached
in a CDN (around three major metropolitan U.S. cities).  
Statistics about user interaction patterns could change often, making the data
more difficult to cache using CDN.

If consumption is all clustered in well-defined areas, using CDN could be very
beneficial.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
23) You are developing an ASP.NET application that hosts an online chat room. 
What Windows Azure Storage options should you consider for storing the contents of these chat rooms?

A. Table storage
B. Queue storage
C. Blob storage
D. CDN storage

A

Correct answer: A
A. Correct: Chatroom data is mostly nonrelational conversations that have structure
to them. This is a perfect candidate for Table storage.
B. Incorrect: Queues are not a good mechanism at all for this type of data because
there is no way to query and fetch data based on those results.
C. Incorrect: Blob storage is a terrible option for this type of data because it would
lose any structure the data had and would be on a slow medium.
D. Incorrect: The CDN would not work for this type of data.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
24) Benefits of using Windows Azure Content Delivery Network include (choose all that apply)?

A. Increased performance for users geographically close to the content source.
B. Increased performance for users geographically far from a content source.
C. Large distributed scale to better handle instanteously increased loads.
D. Improved security.

BC

Correct answers: B, C
A. Incorrect: CDN allows manipulation of nodes to reduce intermediate traffic. The
whole idea is to have nodes closer to the traffic source. Little or no benefit will be
realized if the traffic source is already close.
B. Correct: By specifying nodes closer to the traffic source, increased performance
can be realized.
C. Correct: CDN helps distributed scale issues and is particularly well suited to traffic
spikes and surges (such as ones associated with product launches).
D. Incorrect: CDN doesn’t offer any security advantages that aren’t already present
in Azure offerings that do not take advantage of it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
25) Which of the following queries take advantage of the Content Delivery network?

A. http://atlanta.vo.mysite.net/documents
B. http://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/documents
C. http://myaccount.atlanta.blob.core.windows.net/documents
D. http://atlanta.mysite.net/documents

BC

Correct answer: A
A. Correct: An Azure CDN URL is in the format http://<identifier>.vo.mscend.net/.
B. Incorrect: This is a standard Azure storage URL.
C. Incorrect: This is a standard Azure storage URI with a misplaced identifier.
D. Incorrect: This is a completely malformed Azure storage URI.

To access the content directly from the blob service, the URI is identical to what it was originally:
http://<storage account name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container>/<blob>
To access it directly through the Windows Azure CDN URL, use the following syntax, which is almost identical:
http://<storage account name>.vo.msecnd.net/<container>/<blob>

26) Your company has an application that currently is consumed by in-house applications.
There is a need to make it accessible to outside parties that use this in-house
application but extend it. As such, the capability to consume and manipulate the
data is critical. Enabling users to accomplish this through URI-based semantics
seems like the optimal solution.
With these facts in mind, answer the following questions:

1. Would it be possible to provide access through URI-based semantics using Data Services?
You can use ASP.NET with a WCF data service, to make data available to outside parties using URI-based semantics.
OData Support is one of the main reasons to use WCF Data Services, and it is URI addressable. 
You can query data and do quite a bit with it by changing and manipulating URIs.

Yes, in fact, that’s the primary benefit. Items can be accessed using traditional code or
using URI-based semantics, but in this case, URI semantics would be particularly useful.

2. What operations are easily supported?
QueryOperations are easily supported. QueryOperations are denoted with the $ at the beginning of an operation and can
control a wide variety of functions, including the number of items returned to specifying the TOP x of the resultset.

All Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.

27) You need to create an interceptor that runs each time you try to return Topic items. Which items should you use? (Choose all that apply.)

A. ChangeInterceptor
B. QueryInterceptor
C. DataServiceProtocolVersion
D. SetEntitySetAccessRule

B

Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: This would be right only if the data were being changed. It’s just being
queried.
B. Correct: This is the only one that can handle items when they are queried.
C. Incorrect: This simply would not work for the task at hand or even come close
to it.
D. Incorrect: This simply would not work for the task at hand or even come close
to it.

28) You need to return all questions that have an Id greater than 5. Which query should you use?

A. http://servicehost/ExamPrepService.svc/Questions?$filter=Id gt 5
B. http://servicehost/ExamPrepService.svc/Questions?$filter(ID> 5)
C. http://servicehost/ExamPrepService.svc/Questions(>5)
D. http://servicehost/ExamPrepService.svc/Questions?$select(Id) gt 5

A

Correct answer: A
A. Correct: The entity name, followed by a filter condition using gt for greater than 5
is what’s required here.
B. Incorrect: The query and filter syntax is incorrect.
C. Incorrect: No mention is made of a filter here, and the syntax is incorrect.
D. Incorrect: The id field and operator are correct, but the syntax is incorrect.

Which of the following URI queries is the equivalent?

A. http://Service/Question.svc/Questions?Orderby=QuestionId&?$QuestionNumber ( gt 30)
B. http://Service/Question.svc/Questions?Orderby=QuestionId&?$QuestionNumber gt 30
C. http://Service/Question.svc/Questions?Orderby=QuestionId&?filter=(QuestionNumber > 30)
D. http://Service/Question.svc/Questions?Orderby=QuestionId&?filter=QuestionNumber gt 30

D

Correct answer: D
A. Incorrect: The filter and query syntax are incorrect.
B. Incorrect: The filter and query syntax are incorrect.
C. Incorrect: The filter syntax is incorrect.
D. Correct: The OrderBy field is specified correctly, as is the filter field.

30) You are building an application that makes extensive use of XML. The document
structures follow very consistent patterns, and sometimes large applications to
manipulate these structures are similar.
With this in mind, answer the following questions:

1. Would your application benefit from using LINQ-to-XML?
Yes you can then use XElement(represents an XML fragment.) classes to create XML documents  
You can use LINQ-to-XML features to query  XML files.

The more consistent the structures are, the more any approach will be simplified. LINQ
semantics allow much simpler interaction with the documents, although any of the
existing .NET XML libraries can work.

2. What could be done to simplify consumption of the documents?
Make sure that the structure of the XML documents are validated using a schema xsd.
In this way we are guaranteed that the XML documents have a certain structure. 
Furthermore consumption/processing of XML files can be simplified if you dont use deep nested structures.     

The more consistent the data, the more one approach can be reused. Because the
documents are all similar, the hard part, so to speak, is largely addressed. You might
consider doing an intermediate transform on the documents, though, to render them
as one very consistent format that might make it even simpler.

31) You need to use an ampersand (&) in the name of an element you create with an XElement
item. Which of the following allows a correctly created element name?

A. Just pass in the string to the XElement constructor; it handles it automatically by
calling the XmlConvert class transparently.
B. Manually escape the character sequence.
C. Use the XmlConvert.Encode method to create the string to pass into the constructor.
D. All of the above.

D

Correct answer: D
A. Incorrect: Technically correct, but other answers are all correct, so choice D is the
only one.
B. Incorrect: Technically correct, but other answers are all correct, so choice D is the
only one.
C. Incorrect: Technically correct, but other answers are all correct, so choice D is the
only one.
D. Correct: Because each of the other answers is correct, this one is the right answer.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
32) Which of the following are requirements for a valid and well-formed XML document?

A. Every element must have a corresponding closing element.
B. Every element must have at least one attribute.
C. Every attribute must have a corresponding closing attribute.
D. Elements and attributes can be used interchangeably as long as they have open and closing tags.

A
Correct answer: A
A. Correct: An element can self-close, but each opening element must be closed.
B. Incorrect: Elements might have attributes, but there is no requirement for an element
to have an attribute.
C. Incorrect: Attributes don’t require matching closure tags.
D. Incorrect: Elements can be nested and structured in a way that accomplishes the
same goal as attributes, but attributes can’t contain elements.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
33) You have an object model that has a relational hierarchy three levels deep. 
In ad-dition to one chain that nests three levels deep (parent, child, and grandchild), 
you have four other child relations. In total, you have a parent and five related children, 
and the first child has two children of its own. With this in mind, answer the following questions:

1. Should you pull back the entire chain and all the data, or pull back only a portion and then make roundtrips for the additional data as needed?

There are cases that require you to pull down an entire data set and work with it. There are other times when
you might deal with huge amounts of data that you might never need. If you know
exactly what data you need, lazy loading can actually hurt performance, even when there
are several related entities, because it requires multiple roundtrips to the database instead of
just one. On the other hand, if you aren’t sure of the number of roundtrips and have a high
probability that you won’t need all the data pulled back, lazy loading is generally a better option
because you pull back only the data you need. If you’re not making many roundtrips, the
performance loss is likely going to be trivial.

The answer depends on how the data is used. Chances are that only a portion of the
items in the chain will be referenced frequently. You might have an application that
needs all the data or most of it for every typical use case, however. It depends on the
nature of the application. It should be tested extensively, and logging and tracing
should be used to see how frequently the nonparent data is referenced.

2. If you pull back all the data, what problems might you face?

You could retrieve a huge amount of data resulting in memory usage problems because 
the retrieved data is stored in RAM.   

If you pull back all the data, you might have performance or responsiveness issues,
especially if you have network constraints. If each of the children or grandchildren has
only a few records and is small in size, this will be minimized. However, if there are
substantially sized records or high record counts on any of the descendants, it might
take a lot longer to query and update and could cause serious issues with application
responsiveness.

3. If you choose to lazy load, what problems might you face?

You might need multiple roundtrips to the database. If you’re not making many roundtrips, the
performance loss is likely going to be trivial. 

If you chose to lazy load the data, and it is necessary for the majority of the use cases,
you will cause several roundtrips to the server. Over a constrained network or a lowpowered
device, these frequent roundtrips could easily cause wait times that greatly
exceed the overhead of pulling all the data back at once.

4. How should you go about determining which approach should be used?

You should observe/log data usage in your application. The data used can give you an indication
which data is often used and which is data is used sometimes (low probability of usage).
Highly used data should be loaded and data that is used sometimes, can be loaded using lazy loading.      

Several factors should go into your decision. First, the number of records should be
considered. If you have only one or two records for each of the child relations, and the
record sizes are small, pulling it all down at once will probably be beneficial. But even if
the record count is small or the record size is small, if you don’t need the data, there’s
no use of pulling it down. As such, the typical use cases should be tested extensively,
and you should have logging in place to help build frequency distributions of usage.
This necessitates a good bit more work up front, both in testing and analyzing, but
will pay huge dividends down the road because getting it wrong is very expensive to
correct.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
34) You create a LINQ query as follows. Which of the statements is correct?

	var query = (from acct in context.Accounts
	where acct.AccountAlias == "Primary"
	select Acct).FirstOrDefault();

A. A foreach loop is needed before this query executes against the database.
B. NavigationProperty needs to be referenced before this query executes against the database.
C. The query returns results immediately.
D. It depends on whether the LazyLoadingEnabled property is set.

C
The use of FirstOrDefault method to ensure that you bypass deferred execution because it
requests a scalar value.

Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: Because of the FirstOrDefault, it is executed immediately.
B. Incorrect: With the FirstOrDefault, it is executed immediately and does not need to be iterated.
C. Correct: Because the value is returned immediately, it works without any iteration.
D. Incorrect: Lazy loading is important, but not here.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
35) Assume you call the Add method of a context on an entity that already exists in the database. 
Which of the following is true? (Choose all that apply.)

A. A duplicate entry is created in the database if there is no key violation.
B. If there is a key violation, an exception is thrown.
C. The values are merged using a first-in wins approach.
D. The values are merged using a last-in wins approach. 

AB

Correct answers: A, B
A. Correct: If there is no key constraint violation, a second copy of the entity will be
created in the database.
B. Correct: If there is a key constraint violation, an exception will be thrown.
C. Incorrect: The values will not be merged
D. Incorrect: The values will not be merged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the context with an EntityState of unchanged?

A. A copy of the entity is added to the context with an EntityState of unchanged.
B. A copy of the entity is added to the context with an EntityState of Added.
C. Nothing happens and the call is ignored.
D. The original entity is updated with the values from the new entity, but a copy is not
made. The entity has an EntityState of Unchanged.

D

Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: A copy is not added with an EntityState of Unchanged.
B. Incorrect: A copy is not added with an EntityState of Added.
C. Correct: There isn’t an operation because it already exists.
D. Incorrect: The original entity is not updated or merged.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
37) You have several applications that have been built using older versions of ADO.NET.
Your development team is not very familiar with the EF and is still in the learning
process. Your CTO has decided that everything should be ported to the newest version
of the .NET Framework and all data access should use the EF.
With this in mind, answer the following questions:

1. Would using the Entity providers help facilitate the transition?

The syntax is much closer to old ADO.NET, and it would make some sense to take
an incremental approach. By using similar objects, testing is minimized and there is
a higher likelihood that no new bugs will be introduced. You can make the converse
argument that completely revamping everything saves some time and effort, but using
an incremental approach is probably best in this case.

2. Is the decision to move all code to the EF a sound decision?
No, it would result in a lot of additional work, while ADO.NET is still supported and capable to do the job.   

“Sound” is somewhat relative, and if existing applications are already in place, tested,
and working, any changes introduce the possibility of new bugs. On the other hand,
the EF is clearly the choice that Microsoft has made for data access, and if it is not
done, two skill sets are ultimately needed. It really depends on how important consistency
is and how much legacy code is in place.

3. Should you employ any existing operations as asynchronous?
Asynchronous processing can enhance (UI) responsiveness of an application. 
When changing synchronous operations to asynchronous operations, you need
to make sure that you not create/introduce any concurrency issues      

Asynchronous operations have been available since the inception of .NET. If the operations
should have been asynchronous initially and were implemented statically, this
provides an opportunity to fix it. On the other hand, asynchronous programming is
much more complicated, and bugs are often much harder to find and diagnose. Under
the circumstances, it is prudent to replace the existing provider code with entity data
provider code as closely as possible, unless big mistakes were made originally by overlooking
asynchronous operations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
38) You need to execute a query against a SQL Server database and populate a set of objects. 
The retrieval operation is time-consuming, and users are complaining about sluggishness. 
You need to make sure the application doesn’t seem to “hang” while the operation is taking place. 
Which of the following would accomplish that task? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Use the ExecuteReader method of the EntityCommand class.
B. Use the ExecuteScalarAsync method of the EntityCommand class.
C. Use the ExecuteReaderAsync method of the SqlCommand class.
D. Use the ExecuteReaderAsync method of the System.Data.OleDb.Command class.

Use the Async Readers BC

Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: Using the ExecuteReader method, the EntityCommand would carry as
much, and likely more, overhead than the ADO.NET equivalent. There is no benefit
in processing or on the client side.
B. Incorrect: Using the async call can keep the operation from blocking, but the type
here is incorrect.
C. Correct: Using the ExecuteReaderAsync in conjunction with the SqlCommand
class would accomplish this goal. Overall processing wouldn’t speed up, but the
blocking on the client would be reduced, giving the impression of a much more
responsive UI.
D. Incorrect: Provider-specific libraries are always the fastest. Because this database
is SQL Server, the SqlClient namespace can be used, and it would operate more
quickly and with more features than the more generic OleDb equivalent.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
39) The application you’re working on uses the EF to generate a specific DbContext instance. 
The application enables users to edit several items in a grid and then submit the changes. 
Because the database is overloaded, you frequently experience situations that result in only partial updates. 

What should you do?

A. Call the SaveChanges method of the DbContext instance, specifying the UpdateBehavior.All enumeration value for the Update behavior.
B. Use a TransactionScope class to wrap the call to update on the DbContext instance.
C. Create a Transaction instance by calling the BeginTransaction method of the DbContext Database property. 
Call the SaveChanges method; if it is successful, call the Commit method of the transaction; if not, call the Rollback method.
D. Use a TransactionScope class to wrap the call to SaveChanges on the DbContext. Call Complete if SaveChanges completes without an exception.

CD

Correct answer: D
A. Incorrect: SaveChanges can help the scenario, but only if done in the context of
another transaction. Without one, it is of no value in this case.
B. Incorrect: A TransactionScope would be a good choice, but the DbContext doesn’t
have an Update method, so it is irrelevant.
C. Incorrect: This approach could work, but the transaction would need to be established
on the connection, not on the context.
D. Correct: Calling SaveChanges inside of a TransactionScope and selecting the Complete
property if things are successful accomplishes this goal perfectly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
40) The application you’re working on uses the EF. You need to ensure that operations can be rolled back if 
there is a failure and you need to specify an isolation level. Which of the following would allow you to accomplish this? 
(Choose all that apply.)

A. A EntityTransaction
B. A TransactionScope
C. A SqlTransaction
D. A DatabaseTransaction

ABC

Correct answers: A, B
A. Correct: An EntityTransaction would accomplish each goal as it provides rollback
functionality and setting of an isolation level.
B. Correct: A TransactionScope would accomplish each goal as it provides rollback
functionality and setting of an isolation level.
C. Incorrect: A SqlTransaction would work, but not in this context.
D. Incorrect: There is not a valid class called DatabaseTransaction.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
41) You’re using LINQ to Entities and are experiencing serious performance problems.
Your database administrators (DBAs) insist that your queries are the problem, but
your developers tell you the opposite.

With this in mind, answer the following questions:

1. How can you determine the problem source?
First you can time the duration of executed queries (not using deferred execution).
Furthermore you can inspect the generated SQL query to see if it does not have any faults.  

Obviously, logging is needed to determine what SQL is being sent back to the database.
It is possible that the problem is the queries, the database, or both. The only way
to know is to rule out one thing at a time—in this case, start with the entity logging.

2. What features should you implement?

Depending on the source, the LINQ queries might need restructuring. Lazy loading
and caching might be in order. Moving the queries to stored procedures might help
(not because stored procedures are inherently faster, but because they would yield the
same queries each time, which in turn might help with cached execution plans).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
42) You are executing a query against a LINQ to EDM that contains an Account entity, among others. 
Which of the following are valid choices for storing the data?

A. IListCollection<Account>
B. ObjectQuery<Account>
C. ObjectContext.Account
D. IQueryable<Account>

D

Correct answers: B, D
A. Incorrect: IListCollection is not a valid interface and would not work.
B. Correct: ObjectQuery implements IOrderedQueryable, IQueryable, IEnumerable,
IListSource, and Account is a valid type.
C. Incorrect: The ObjectContext base class does not have or use a custom Account
entity.
D. Correct: IQueryable passing in the Account type will definitely work.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
43) Which interfaces must be implemented in order for something to be queried by LINQ? (Choose all that apply.)

A. IEnumerable
B. IQueryable
C. IEntityItem
D. IDbContextItem

AB

Correct answers: A, B
A. Correct: The item must be either IEnumerable or IQueryable.
B. Correct: The item must be IEnumerable or IQueryable.
C. Incorrect: IEntityItem will not work and has no value here.
D. Incorrect: IDbContextItem will not work and has no value here outside of the current zone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
44) You’ve made extensive use of DataAdapters, and your application has been performing
well. Lately, though, it has started to slow down dramatically, and users
report that the longer they use the application, the more sluggish it becomes.

With this in mind, answer the following questions:

1. One manager is sure that it is a memory leak or something related to not closing
connections, How can you determine the validity of such a statement?

Using the databaseprofier, you can determine the number of open database connection.
Furtheremore you can use the Application profiler of VS to monitor the application 
(Nr of connections, memory usage etc.). Finally you can use Windows Performance counters
to monitor. In the application you can add logging to time method calls, and see which one
takes a long time.         

If you’re opening the adapters, there’s a possibility they aren’t being closed and
disposed of properly. However, if you’re relying on the adapter to open and close the
connection, it is unlikely that it is the problem. The more likely issue is that you are
caching too much data locally, and it is being held on to well past its useful life. Less
caching and more round trips to the database might actually help in this case, depending
on the exact nature of the problem, but each area should be looked at.

2. What might you do to speed things up?
First you need to determine the cause of the delays before you can fix it.
You can use SQL server Connection pools to speed up connection with the database.  
Make sure that you connect to the database for the least amount of time.
In order to avoid memory leaks, make sure you dispose objects that are no longer needed.    

Overuse of a DataAdapter could be a problem. Remember that an adapter always uses
a DataReader. There might be times when individual values are being queried using
an adapter that could be replaced with a DataReader. You might be able to determine
counts and aggregates from the returned data instead of executing aggregate queries.
You might be able to rely less on joins and use DataRelations locally to enforce constraints.
You could also consider disabling and reenabling constraints before and after
load operations.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
45) You need to execute the following SELECT query using the COUNT aggregate to determine
the total record count in a table:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ExamQuestions;
Which of the following enables you to do that? (Choose all that apply.)

A. SqlDataAdapter in conjunction with a SqlDataReader
B. SqlDataAdapter in conjunction with a DataTable
C. SqlDataAdapter in conjunction with a DataSet
D. The SqlDataReader ExecuteScalar method

D

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient.sqldataadapter?view=dotnet-plat-ext-3.1
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient.sqldatareader?view=dotnet-plat-ext-
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient.sqlcommand.executescalar?view=dotnet-plat-ext-3.1

Correct answers: B, C, D
A. Incorrect: A SqlDataAdapter cannot be used with a SqlDataReader together at all.
B. Correct: A SqlDataAdapter and a DataSet will work for this (use the Rows property
of the primary DataTable).
C. Correct: A SqlDataAdapter and a DataTable will work for this (use the Rows property
of the DataTable).
D. Correct: ExecuteScalar would work assuming that the COUNT aggregate function
was used, which it was.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
46) Which of the following are true about SqlConnection objects? (Choose all that apply.)

A. They should be opened at the last possible moment and closed at the earliest opportunity.
B. They should be opened as early as possible and closed as early as possible.
C. They should be opened as late as possible and closed as late as possible.
D. As long as the Close statement is called in a catch block, the object will be closed and disposed of correctly.

A

Correct answer: A
A. Correct: Leaving connections open when they aren’t being used is wasteful and
can cause serious performance problems. Accordingly, they should always be
opened at the last possible moment before they are needed and closed immediately
when they are no longer needed.
B. Incorrect: Opening a connection before it is needed is wasteful and could have
serious performance implications.
C. Incorrect: Leaving a connection open when it is no longer needed is wasteful and
could cause serious performance problems.
D. Incorrect: Calling Close in a Finally block, or wrapping it in a using statement
would ensure that it is closed properly. If Close is called inside a Catch block, it is
entirely possible that another exception could be thrown there, leading to the connection
dangling unclosed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
47) What are the advantages of a compiled query?

A. None. Every time you run the query you will hit the database.
B. The results of the query are cached making the querying a lot faster.
C. The translation of your query into SQL is cached.
D. None. You can’t change any of the parameters you use in a query, rendering the compiled query useless.

C

Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: It’s true that you will hit the database each time you execute the query.
But there is still a performance gain because a compiled query caches the steps
required to convert your query to SQL.
B. Incorrect: It’s not the results of the query that are cached. Instead the generated
SQL is cached. This can be parameterized to get specific data from the database.
C. Correct: By caching the generated SQL a compiled query can execute faster.
D. Incorrect: The generated SQL is cached but it’s also parameterized so you can
specify new values for your parameters on each execution.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
48) You have a huge set of legacy code that employs traditional ADO.NET. You have
been charged with moving it to the EF.
With this in mind, answer the following questions:

1. Should you use POCOs or use entities exclusively?

The most easy way to implement EF in a legacy system is to use EF to populate your existing business objects and
leave everything else in place, hence you would use POCOs that are already present in the legacy system. 

POCOs might make sense; they might not. The more you’re moving to Entities, the less
relevant POCOs will generally be, although that’s a general statement and there are
plenty of exceptions. If you have the POCOs already, it would help make the case to
continue their use. If not, and you’re using DataSets and DataTables exclusively, moving
to Entities completely would probably make more sense.

2. Would it make sense to use EF to populate your existing business objects and leave everything else in place?

If your existing business objects can be mapped to the DataBase using EF, you can use EF to populate your business objects.   

One could make the case that just changing the plumbing, so to speak, would be a
good intermediate strategy. But generally it is not worth the effort. If there’s a ton
of code with a lot of complex UI behavior, it could provide some benefit because
you wouldn’t need to regression test as much. On the other hand, for smaller-sized
projects, it is probably just a waste of extra effort with very little value proposition.

49) Which of the following are necessary components of an EDM? (Choose all that apply.)

A. SSDL
B. MSL
C. CSDL
D. .edmx

ABCD

Correct answers: A, B, C, D
A. Correct: The SSDL file is necessary to define the database schema information.
B. Correct: The MSL file is necessary to define the mappings between the other two
files.
C. Correct: The CSDL file is necessary to define the entity layer of the application.
D. Correct: The MSL, CSDL, and SSDL files are all necessary and are rolled into the
.edmx file.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
50)You have been tasked with completing a coworker’s data model. You are told that
there are some specific issues in the .ssdl file and the .msl file, but when you look at the
project, you don’t see either of them. What is the problem?

A. The actual .csdl file no longer exists because it has been consolidated in the .edmx
files. Its logical purpose is still contained and present, however.
B. The actual .msl file no longer exists because it has been consolidated in the .edmx
files. Its logical purpose is still contained and present, however.
C. The actual .csdl file no longer exists because it has been consolidated in the .edmx
files. Because it is no longer needed, there is no need to reference it or for anything
to try to replace it.
D. The actual .msl file no longer exists because it has been consolidated in the .edmx
files. Because it is no longer needed, there is no need to reference it or for anything
to try to replace it.

AB

Correct answers: A, B
A. Correct: The CSDL file doesn’t physically exist in later versions of EF. However, the
core of what they do is still needed; they just take a different form and are consolidated
inside the .edmx model.
B. Correct: The MSL file doesn’t physically exist in later versions of EF. However, the
core of what they do is still needed; they just take a different form and are consolidated
inside the .edmx model.
C. Incorrect: The CSDL file contents might be incorporated into the .edmx file, but
the service it provides is still necessary. Without an equivalent functionality, the
model will not work.
D. Incorrect: The MSL file contents might be incorporated into the .edmx file, but the
service it provides is still necessary. Without an equivalent functionality, the model
will not work.

51) You are building an ADO.NET Entity Framework application. You need to validate each
of the models. Which Entity Data Model tool can you use to accomplish this?

A. The EDM Generator (EdmGen.exe)
B. ADO.NET Entity Data Model Designer
C. Entity Data Model Wizard
D. Update Model Wizard

A

Correct answers: A, B
A. Correct The EdmGen.exe tool can be used with the ValidateArtifacts switch to
validate a model.
B. Correct: The ADO.NET entity model designer can be used to validate models.
C. Incorrect: The entity data model wizard may validate a model during creation but
will not perform the validation after the fact.
D. Incorrect: The Update Model Wizard is intended to let you update an .edmx file
after changes have been made to the underlying database. It is not intended to
perform validation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
52) You are building a WCF Service. There are several methods that you do not want to
expose to clients but need to use internally. Several complex types, including enumerations,
will be transferred between the client and server. Although the majority
of your clients are using .NET, you want to make sure that any decision errs on the
side of interoperability. With this in mind, answer the following questions:

1. How should you handle the methods that you don’t want publicly exposed?

You can have methods that are defined in the service that are not defined in the interface, 
but they are not accessible from a client application. Similarly, you can have members defined 
in the interface that are not decorated with the OperationContract attribute, but if they are 
not decorated accordingly, they aren’t part of the service as far as the rest of the world is concerned.

You have a few options here. One straightforward method would be to mark only the
methods you want publicly exposed with the OperationContract attribute and leave
the other ones undefined. You could alternately move all the private methods to another
interface and have the service implement both the original interface and the new
one.

2. How should you handle the enumeration types and the complex types?

Types that participate in WCF operations must be serializable. 
When using DataContracts, you indicate that the .NET type decorated with the
DataContract attribute is serialized. The DataContract explicitly puts forth
all necessary information about how the data it represents will be serialized.
You can use the KnownTypeAttribute (or just KnownType) to specify that a given 
type be included during deserialization. Furtheremore, you need to specify either 
the DataMember attribute or EnumMember in case of enumerations for each property 
you want serialized.

You have several options, but the most straightforward would be to use the
DataContract serializer for both the complex types and the enumeration types. This
would add a layer of consistency while keeping things simple. On the enumeration
values, you would decorate them with the EnumMember attribute. On the members of
the complex type you want exposed, you would decorate them with the DataMember
attribute.

3. Should anything special be done to deal with exceptions?

In order not to expose the details of the implementation, you need to use FaultContract attributes.
FaultContract attribute Provide information on exceptions in a platform-agnostic manner.
The reason we use FaultContracts is that as helpful as structured exception handling is, 
.NET exceptions are technology-specific to the .NET Framework. That means that Java, Python, 
Visual Basic 6.0, and so on have no idea what a .NET exception is (even if the other language 
features structured exception handling). FaultContracts enable services to communicate failures 
to the client in a safe, intentional, and mutually acceptable fashion.

Furtheremore, .NET exceptions contain a lot of detailed information about your services inner workings,
information that you dont want to expose to the outside world. Now, if you specifically decide that
certain information can be conveyed, you can use FaultContracts to define when information
can be sent and what information is sent. This enables you to give the clients some information
they might need for their applications without exposing your service to unnecessary risk.  

Furtheremore, there are cases in which you might want to exert control over fault handling at a much
more granular level than what is provided out of the box. As noted previously, you can specify
the FaultReason or FaultCode to do this. If you want more control, you can use the Message-
Fault class, which gives you an in-memory representation of the fault. It enables you to tailor
the details of the fault as specifically as you want.

To maximize interoperability, there are several things that can be done including the
choice of bindings (however, that’s not been covered yet). The main thing so far would
be to make sure that you use FaultContracts to wrap exceptions and pass them back to
the client.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
53) You’ve implemented a method named GetQuestionText that can throw an
IndexOutOfRangeException or a SqlException. Which of the following items would
correctly expose these exceptions?

A. 	[FaultContract(typeof(IndexOutOfRangeException))]
	[FaultContract(typeof(SqlException))]
	[OperationContract]
	String GetQuestionText(Int32 questionNumber);
B.	[FaultMapping(new FaultMappingCollection[]{IndexOutOfRangeException,SqlException})]
	[OperationContract]
	String GetQuestionText(Int32 questionNumber);
C.	[FaultMapping(new FaultMappingCollection[]{typeof(IndexOutOfRangeException), typeof(SqlException)})]
	[OperationContract]
	String GetQuestionText(Int32 questionNumber);
D.	[FaultContract(IndexOutOfRangeException)]
	[FaultContract(SqlException)]
	[OperationContract]
	String GetQuestionText(Int32 questionNumber);

A

Correct answer: A
A. Correct: A FaultContract is specified using each of the two types that need to be
supported.
B. Incorrect: There is no relevant FaultMapping attribute.
C. Incorrect: There is no relevant FaultMapping attribute.
D. Incorrect: The FaultContract definition attribute is the correct one to use, but the
type needs to be specified in conjunction with the Type.

54) Which of the following are true regarding WCF Services and their contracts? 
(Choose all that apply.)

A. Each service must have a corresponding Interface class.
B. The ServiceContract and OperationContract attributes must be applied to the contract, not the implementation.
C. The ServiceContract and OperationContract attributes can be applied to either the contract or the implementation.
D. A complex type does not need to be serializable as long as all its properties are serializable.

AC

The ServiceContract and OperationContract attributes can be defined on the service implementation or the contract, but not both.
A service is denoted by the use of the ServiceContract attribute. You can decorate your
class definition with the ServiceContract attribute, but it makes much more sense to add the
definition to the interface instead. Because the Service has to implement the interface, applying
the ServiceContract attribute to the interface definition has the effect of basically marking
the class as a ServiceContract.

Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: A service needs a “contract,” and that’s usually handled via an interface,
but it does not necessarily have to be an interface.
B. Incorrect: The ServiceContract and OperationContract attributes need to be applied
to either the interface or the class definition.
C. Correct: The ServiceContract attribute and the OperationContract attribute can be
applied to either the interface or the implementation, but not both.
D. Incorrect: Any type transferred through the service must be serializable.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
55) You are tasked with adding a method named GetCurrentStockPrice to an existing service.
The Service is named QuoteService and it implements the IQuoteService Contract.
How should you go about adding this new method? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Add the method definition to the IQuoteService Contract.
B. Add the OperationContract attribute to the method definition.
C. Add the OperationBehavior attribute to the method definition.
D. Create a new ServiceContract class and add the GetCurrentStockPrice method to it.

AB

Correct answers: A, B
A. Correct: The method definition should be added to the service contract .
B. Correct: The OperationContract attribute must be added to the method or the
method definition. In this case, it should be the method.
C. Incorrect: Adding an OperationBehavior would be of no benefit here.
D. Incorrect: Adding a new ServiceContract would not do any good without making
the service implement the contract as well.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
56) You are building a WCF Service. You expect a tremendous growth in clients and will
likely have to support and change quite a few different features. Your service will be
hosted internally, so you have full access to it without any real restrictions.
With this in mind, answer the following questions:

1. Would it make sense to use configuration to host custom bindings?

Yes, you can specify just about everything needed to make a service operate as desired using
a configuration file without having to rebuild it and redeploy it.

It would definitely make sense to use configuration for custom bindings (and any others,
for that matter). You could use an imperative approach for items you are absolutely
sure of, but you can do everything discussed here through configuration, so there’s
probably a big benefit to keeping things consistent.

2. What bindings would you choose to configure? 

The communication mode you want to use HTTP, named pipes, TCP, MSMQ.
Interoperability mode, you can for example specify Basic, Duplex or Simplex communication. 
EndpointBehavior such as security: (clientCredentials) by using for example wsHttpEndpoint, transaction batching, the DataContract serializer, and much more.
ServiceBehaviors enable you to control several aspects of the service at a granular level.

<behaviors>
	<endpointBehaviors>
		<behavior name="wsHttpBehaviorSample">
			<clientCredentials />
		</behavior>
	</endpointBehaviors>
	<serviceBehaviors>
		<behavior name="Debug">
			<serviceDebug />
		</behavior>
	</serviceBehaviors>
</behaviors>

You could certainly go ahead and add every binding you can imagine that you’ll need.
Multiple bindings can be supported, although the particular host can limit what is
supported. The best approach, however, is to go ahead and set up the items that you
know for sure you need now. You can easily add new bindings and tweak the configuration
as you go along and find out about new requirements. Configuring everything
up-front has many downsides, and the cost of adding a new configuration binding is
relatively small.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
57) What are the minimum steps that must be performed to configure a service using the WCF Service Configuration Editor? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Specify a new service.
B. Specify a MetadataExchange endpoint.
C. Specify a security configuration.
D. Specify a contract.

AD

The Metadata Exchange endpoint is used by the service to describe itself to clients,
and if you hit the endpoint you’ll see the wsdl of the service, which clients can use 
to gather whatever information you made available about the service.

Specifying security configuration and Specifying a MetadataExchange endpointis are optional.

Objective 3.2: Review
1. Correct answers: A, D
A. Correct: A new service must be specified.
B. Incorrect: Although useful, particularly for discovery, a MetadataExchange endpoint
does not need to be configured for a service to correctly operate.
C. Incorrect: Not specifying security is ill-advised, but the default settings work if no
security values are configured. Hence, it is not absolutely necessary to operate.
D. Correct: A contract absolutely must be specified, along with defining the service
itself.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
58) Which of the following items can be handled through configuration? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Defining the service’s type.
B. Defining the service’s contract.
C. Specifying a security configuration.
D. Adding metadata exchange.

CD 

NOT B You can specify the service and service contract in the App.config but you cannot define a service contract, 
you define a service contract in code (the interface).

Correct answers: A, B, C, D
A. Correct: A new service can be defined through configuration.
B. Correct: A service’s contract type can be defined through configuration.
C. Correct: A service’s security configuration can be defined through configuration.
D. Correct: Adding metadata exchange can be implemented through configuration.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
59) Which of the following is not a benefit of configuration?

A. Ability to change Endpoint URIs
B. Ability to modify security settings
C. Ability to redefine metadata exchange
D. Ability to add new method definitions 

D

Correct answer: D
A. Incorrect: Endpoint URIs can be easily changed through configuration.
B. Incorrect: A service’s security settings can be easily changed through
configuration.
C. Incorrect: Metadata exchange can be added, removed, or modified through
configuration.
D. Correct: Changes to a method definition or implementation can be made cited
through code.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
60) You are building a WCF Service, and you have all the requirements for the service’s
foreseeable future clearly defined. You have all your options open with respect to
implementation.

With this in mind, answer the following questions:

1. Should you lean toward a configuration-based approach, try to define everything
imperatively (hardcoding settings), or use a mixed approach?

You can use a mixed approach, hard-coded values when necessary else use configuration-based values.     
The more you hard-code, the less flexibility there is. You can define a binding in code, for example,
and use a configuration element to specify an endpoint address. Doing this would give
you more flexibility than hard-coding all the values, but it would still force your hand in terms
of what bindings were used. If you use configuration, you can accomplish most of the same
things you would through hard-coding, but not the other way around.

2. What downside would you experience if you defined everything imperatively?

You have no flexibility to change application settings without recompiling the application. 

3. What downside would you experience if you defined everything in configuration?

You have more flexibility to change application settings, hence the application users can 
also change settings that were not meant to be changed.   

There are good reasons to use every one of the mentioned approaches. The more
well-defined the application requirements, the less risk there is to using a completely
imperative approach. The less clear the requirements, the more likely you are to benefit
from using configuration. Using a hybrid approach can enable you to have the best
of both worlds, and you don’t have to make a definitive choice one way or the other.
If you’re hosting the service internally and have full access to it, configuration carries
little cost or risk. In some Windows Azure-based hosting scenarios, you have to use a
more imperative approach, although you can still use a hybrid approach here.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
61) You are creating a CustomBinding that will be consumed only by .NET clients. Performance is the primary concern. 
Which of the following are true? (Choose all that apply.)

A. You must define a TextMessageEncodingBindingElement to the binding.
B. You must define a BinaryMessageEncodingBindingElement to the binding.
C. You must not define either the TextMessageEncodingBindingElement or the MTOMMessageEncodingBindingElement.
D. You must define the BinaryMessageEncodingBindingElement. 

B

TextMessageEncodingBinding is the simplest of the available items, and it’s the most
interoperable. That’s easy to understand because text is universally accessible. Although
it’s the best for interoperability, it’s the worst for performance and efficiency precisely
because it transports everything as text—so its biggest strength is also its greatest weakness.

BinaryMessageEncodingFormat does exactly what its name implies; it serializes and
deserializes messages through binary. However, it uses a .NET-specific format, so it’s least
interoperable but the most efficient of the available formats.

MTOMMessageEncoding-BindingElement tries to strike a balance between efficiency and interoperability. It transmits
most of the XML as text, but it leaves large blocks of binary data as they are without
converting them to base64 encoding.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
62) The ServiceOperation attribute is defined on both the service implementation and the interface definition. 
Each of the property settings is explicitly defined, and each property matches its counterpart in the other definition. 
Which of the following is true?

A. As long as the property values are identical or don’t conflict with each other, the service will behave as desired.
B. The items defined on the interface will override the ones on the implementation class.
C. The items defined in the implementation class will override the ones on the interface definition.
D. The service will throw an InvalidOperationException because this attribute cannot be defined on both items.

D

Correct answer: D
A. Incorrect: Even if they’re defined in an identical manner, there would be a conflict
and resulting exception.
B. Incorrect: There would be a conflict; they can’t co-exist without a problem.
C. Incorrect: There would be a conflict; they can’t co-exist without a problem.
D. Correct: The service would definitely throw an InvalidOperationException, as
indicated.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
63) Which of the following are valid transport binding elements when defining a custom binding?

A. TcpTransportBindingElement
B. TcpBinding
C. HttpTransportBindingElement
D. MTOMTransportBindingElement

AC

Correct answers: A, C
A. Correct: A TcpTransportBindingElement can be used with a CustomBinding.
B. Incorrect: A TcpBinding can be used, but it is not a binding element; it is an actual
binding.
C. Correct: A HttpTransportBindingElement can be used with a CustomBinding.
D. Incorrect: While MTOM can be used, it is not a specific BindingElement that can
be used with a CustomBinding.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
64) You are building several WCF Services, and some will employ sensitive information.
Others transfer information that is completely public and are intended to be as easy
to use as possible. Your service will be hosted internally, so you have full access to it
without any real restrictions.

With this in mind, answer the following questions:

1. For the secure information, would you choose message level security, transport level security, or both?

The most usual way to secure information is using transport level security. Depending on how sensitive
the information is, you can choose both (message and transport level security).       

Message and transport security aren’t mutually exclusive; they are complementary, in
fact. There is additional overhead with more security implemented, but that overhead
can be worked around. Getting it wrong can destroy your company and cause many
problems for your clients, and estimating the full scope of damage is difficult to do.
Generally speaking, people are much more tolerant of a slight performance loss (especially
if they understand why) than they are of a data breach.

2. For the less-sensitive information, would you still want to implement any security?

Yes you want service Integrity, because you dont want that message sent by the WCF service be tampered with without being detected.  

You can go overboard with anything, but there is little inconvenience to implementing
either approach. Moreover, even if something is intended to be public, you still would
have an incentive to keep some level of control over it. Many people are inherently
concerned about any insecure communication. You have complete control here, so
there’s quite a bit of flexibility in terms of what you want to identify.

3. Would certificate-based security be a good fit for either scenario?

No because some of the services are public so there are a lot of clients that need the certificate. 
Because in order to use certificate-based security you need to install certificates on the client.      
If you distribute the service certificate on a large scale to clients, it difficult to avoid abuse.   

Certificate-based security has many upsides and it’s desirable in many circumstances,
but it does add a level of implementation complexity that many find inconvenient and
cumbersome. If it’s not necessary, it’s probably more hassle than benefit.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
65) You are using IIS to host a WCF Service. Which of the following would help implement transport security 
over http (https) without removing previously existing functionality?

A. The new Https protocol mapping feature
B. Use of a wsHttpsBinding instead of a wsHttpBinding
C. Enabling https for the virtual directory that contained the WCF Service items
D. Ensuring that a metadata is enabled for the service

D (If metadata means adding the security node in the app.config or WCF Service Configuration Editor)

To secure the message, you simply need to set the Security.Mode property to the corresponding binding’s 
SecurityMode enumeration indicating that message security should be set.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/samples/ws-transport-security
<bindings>  
  <wsHttpBinding>  
	<!-- configure wsHttpbinding with Transport security mode  
			   and clientCredentialType as None -->  
	<binding name="Binding1">  
	  <security mode="Transport">  
		<transport clientCredentialType="None"/>  
	  </security>  
	</binding>  
  </wsHttpBinding>  
</bindings>  

1. Correct answers: A, B, C
A. Correct: Using protocol mapping will help in this situation.
B. Correct: Using a secure binding will help in this situation.
C. Correct: Enabling https on the virtual directory will help in this situation.
D. Incorrect: Enabling metadata will do nothing to help facilitate transport security.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
66) Which of the following are true regarding WCF security? (Choose all that apply.)

A. You can implement message level security
B. You can implement transport level security
C. You can implement both transport level and message level security
D. Transport security can be enabled, and message security can be enabled, but they cannot both be enabled at the same time

ABC

Correct answers: A, B, C
A. Correct: You can implement message level security in WCF.
B. Correct: Transport level security can be implemented.
C. Correct: Message and transport security can be implemented together.
D. Incorrect: Both can be implemented together and often are; they are not in conflict
with each other.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
67) You are developing a WCF Service. The service must implement transport security, NTLM authentication, and NetTcpBindings. 
Which of the following do you need? (Choose all that apply.)

A. binding value of netTcpBinding
B. clientCredentialType of netTcpBinding
C. clientCredentialType of Transport
D. security mode value of Transport

AD
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/transport-security-with-windows-authentication

Correct answers: A, B, D
A. Correct: A netTcpBinding must be defined.
B. Correct: A clientCredentialType of netTcpBinding must be defined.
C. Incorrect: A clientCredentialType of Transport is not needed.
D. Correct: A SecurityMode value of Transport must be specified.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
68) You are building several WCF Services. You have several different clients on several
different operating system versions.

With this in mind, answer the following questions:

1. Do you recommend the Add Service Reference feature or Svcutil.exe?

I would recommend using Svcutil.exe, because this tool allows you to create client code in different programming languages, such as:
c#, vb and c++.

Both can get you to the same place, but the Add Service Reference dialog box has a
few restrictions. First, it necessitates having Visual Studio, which won’t be a problem
for clients using .NET, but might be a problem for others. Similarly, the Add Service
Reference dialog box walks you through the nuances of creating a proxy class, but its
strength is its weakness. Because it is visual, it is a manual process and cannot be easily
called in a build script or through process automation.

2. Do you recommend that the client proxies support generics or arrays?

I would recommend that the client proxies support arrays, because arrays are more universal used in services and hence clients should support it.

Generics are powerful and make development a lot more attractive. However, only
.NET languages support generics. Using arrays maximizes interoperability. Moreover,
converting an array to a generic is simple to do, particularly if you’re using a .NET
language.

3. What other considerations might you find?

Older versions of the .NET Framework did not support generics. LINQ was introduced
in version 3.0 of the Framework as well. You have the power to use Svcutil.exe to generate
several different languages, which is beneficial. Additionally, if you need to work
with a WCF Service as a traditional web service, you can easily have that done.

Note: 
There are three ways to interact with the service,
two of which accomplish the same task, just doing it slightly differently. The first is using the
Svcutil.exe application to generate a proxy class. The next is to generate the proxy using the
Add Service Reference feature of Visual Studio. These two do the same thing, but entail different
actions on your part. The final way is to use the ChannelFactory class.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
69) You need to build a client-side proxy class in VB.NET for a WCF Service named TestService that is hosted by one of your vendors. 
Which of the following options would accomplish that task? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Use the Svcutil.exe command-line tool with the following command: Svcutil.exe http://www.myvendor.com/TestService.svc
B. Use the Svcutil.exe command-line tool with the following command: Svcutil.exe /l:visualbasic http://www.myvendor.com/TestService.svc.
C. Use the Add Service Reference dialog box.
D. Use the ChannelFactory class.

BCD

Correct answers: B, C, D
A. Incorrect: Although the proxy would be successfully generated, absent a specific
switch for Visual Basic, C# code would be generated.
B. Correct: Using Svcutil with the l switch and indicating a valid language works.
C. Correct: Using the Add Service Reference dialog box works because it’s designed
to handle this use case in particular.
D. Correct: ChannelFactory works in this case.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
70) You are building a client to consume a WCF Service named TestService, and many of the methods have return types that 
are generic list collections. You are expecting List<Type> return types for the calls, but the proxy class has implemented 
each as an array. You want this type implemented specifically as the List<Type>. What should you do? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Use the ToList<> extension method at the end of each call to the methods that are currently being returned as arrays.
B. Change the Settings in the Add Service Reference dialog box using the Advanced screen. Change the Collection type to List.
C. Regenerate the proxy class after changing the settings.
D. Use the Add Web Reference dialog box to generate the proxy because it automatically respects the return type definitions.

AB

Use the ToList<> extension method:
int[] array = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
List<int> list = array.ToList();
Console.WriteLine(String.Join(",", list));

Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: Calling ToList works, but it’s an extra step and doesn’t directly address
the problem.
B. Correct: This is the feature designed specifically to handle this situation.
C. Incorrect: Regenerating the proxy alone does nothing.
D. Incorrect: The default behavior of the Add Web Reference dialog box is used to
add an older form of the service; it does not handle the conversions correctly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
71) Svcutil.exe provides which of the following features? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Validates compiled service code.
B. Downloads metadata documents from deployed services.
C. Generates serialization code.
D. Adds metadata exchange endpoints to deployed services.

BC

Correct answers: A, B, C
A. Correct: Svcutil.exe can be used to validate compiled service code.
B. Correct: Downloading metadata documents from deployed services is one of the
features of Svcutil.exe.
C. Correct: .Generating serialization code is one of the features of SvcUtil.exe.
D. Incorrect: Svcutil.exe does not add metadata exchange to running services.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
72) You are building several WCF Services. You have to get the service out immediately, but there’s strong 
reason to believe you’re going to have to quickly implement many new features and additional versions.
With this in mind, answer the following questions:

1. How can you avoid breaking changes?

If you implement a change to a service, and there is no disruption of service or functionality
with any of the consumers, it’s a nonbreaking change. Everything else is a breaking change.
You need to make sure that the changes are compatible. Data contracts need to be compatible. 
Hence the addition of some new types to the Data contract would present no problems.   
However, the modification of an existing DataContract or the removal of an existing DataContract 
would present problems because changes to the interface will cause compilation to fail.

Breaking changes are a part of life. There’s often no way to avoid them, particularly
when you have to deploy something immediately that you know will change frequently.
Breaking changes are inconvenient, and many people refuse to move to new
products because of them. Planning and thinking about future features helps reduce
the probability that you’ll run into them, but it’s no guarantee that you won’t have to
implement them. In some cases, it might be advisable to try to consolidate breaking
changes in another service and have the existing service make calls to it. The more you
can consolidate and obscure from clients, the less of a problem they’ll be. You are always
in a position to deal with internal breaking changes more easily than your clients
will be.

2. If you have breaking changes that you are forced to implement, how would you handle them?

You should have a clear strategy for rolling breaking changes out, making consumers aware of them, 
and informing consumers how to deal with the consequences of such changes. 

Communication is the only way to mitigate problems associated with breaking
changes. An extensive testing plan is needed to avoid breaking changes and the problems
associated with them. Breaking changes are bad enough, but coupled with bugs,
you’ll have angry customers in all likelihood. There are several articles that deal with
the issue, and becoming familiar with the process is absolutely critical. Telling clients
of the breaking changes with as much advance notice as possible is one mitigation
strategy. Making sure that everyone knows about them so no one is surprised will also
help. Precise details about what the changes will be; what will be affected; and, ideally,
suggestions on how best to deal the changes will also help. If you have to deal with a
breaking change, it’s much easier to do with a clear definition of what’s changing and a
six-month planning window. Flip it around and imagine that you find out the changes
have already been made and your users are already dealing with problems. Imagine
that you get an early notice, but you get several updates that change the nature of
what you’ve already changed. In the final analysis, the fewer interruptions, the more
predictability, and the more certainty clients have, the easier it will be for them to deal
with the changes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
73) Version 10 of the TestService (which implements the ITestService interface) is about to be updated and deployed. 
The ITestService interface adds two new methods, both of which are scoped with the public modifier and are decorated 
with the OperationContract attribute. Which of the following is true?

A. The two additions will be considered breaking changes unless each assembly includes the correct version number.
B. The two additions will not be breaking changes because they leave all previous functionality in place and just add new functionality.
C. As long as the service and contract pairs are both deployed with their respective version numbers (versions 10, 11), clients will not encounter any problems.
D. Answers B and C. 

B

Correct answers: A, C
A. Correct: Contract changes are a breaking change.
B. Incorrect: Additions don’t remove functionality, but are still a breaking change.
C. Correct: As long as the old service with its old definitions is still in place, the addition
of a new service will not cause a problem.
D. Incorrect: Because B is incorrect, this item is incorrect.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
74) Version 10 of the TestService assembly (which also includes the ITestService interface and implements it) 
adds two new methods to the interface definition. The new methods use the Protected modifier and do not currently 
contain the OperationContract attribute (on either the interface or the implementation). 

Which of the following is true?

A. There will not be breaking changes on any items that statically link to the assembly.
B. There will not be breaking changes because the access modifiers are set to Protected.
C. There will not break changes because they don’t implement the OperationContract attribute.
D. It will be a breaking change to any assembly statically linked to it unless the new methods are also added to the implementation.

C: From a WCF service perspective, because of the lack of the OperationContract attribute.  

D If you add methods to an interface, the service that implements the interface must add the new methods.  
Because the new methods do not currently contain the OperationContract attribute, they are not visible to 
the outside world (WCF clients who connect to service). 

Methods defined in an interface are always public? Prior to C# 8, interface members were public by default. 
In fact, if you put an access modifier on an interface member (including public), it would generate a compiler error.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
75) Which versioning strategies are supported through WCF?

A. Strict Versioning
B. Lax Versioning
C. Mixed-Mode Versioning
D. Contract Versioning

AB

Lax versioning
WCF and even .asmx web services have support for lax versioning. Lax versioning means that minor changes 
can often be made without breaking the existing contract. It’s possible, for example, that you can add 
a new member and the data will just be ignored.

Strict Versioning
To make sure that you don’t cause any problems, you must ensure that any newly generated messages from your 
updated service validate against the old schema. The safest way to have this assurance is to never change 
existing contracts and just create new contracts, ideally ones with new and assuredly distinct XML namespaces.

Correct answers: A, B, D
A. Correct: Strict versioning can be implemented with WCF.
B. Correct: Lax versioning can be implemented with WCF.
C. Incorrect: Mixed-mode versioning would defeat the purpose or either approach.
D. Correct: Contract versioning is supported and necessary in most cases.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
76) You are consulting for a customer that is thinking about how to expose his private
and confidential data to employees who work remotely. The customer is currently
hosting his data in his own datacenter. Currently, employees can synchronize a copy
of their data only when they are at the office.

With this in mind, answer the following questions:

1. Would you recommend the customer use a cloud or for a hybrid solution? Why?

I Would recommend a hybrid solution because the customer is currently
hosting his data in his own datacenter. Furtheremore the customer can
be reluctant to host his private and confidential data in the cloud.      

Because the customer is dealing with private and confidential data, a cloud-only solution
will probably not appeal to them. By offering a hybrid solution, he can control the
data while having all the benefits of a secure public interface hosted in Azure.

2. How can the relaying capabilities of the service bus help your customer?

Employees can also synchronize a copy of their data outside the office.
The benefit with using the service bus functionality is that it complements your
already existing WCF bindings. This means that you can expose internal endpoints for your
service that can be used to integrate with on-premise applications and that you can expose
special endpoints to connect to the service bus. You can use the the service bus functionality 
and send a message to it. The relay takes your message and passes it to the hosting service that can run anywhere.

One of the key features of the Azure Service Bus is its capability to create secure connections
through a firewall. This means that you won’t have to make any changes to your onpremise
configuration to allow the Service Bus to communicate with your service. Normally,
this is done using TCP ports (both over SSL or unencrypted). If those ports aren’t available,
relaying can also use the default HTPP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443) ports.

The service bus can offer a relaying endpoint to client applications that run on the
devices of the employees The relay then securely forwards messages to the on-premise
datacenter. This creates a secured way of exposing data.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
77) Which elements do you need from the management portal when configuring your
host service? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Namespace
B. NetTcpRelayBinding
C. ServiceHost
D. Default Key

BCD

The benefit with using the service bus functionality is that it complements your
already existing WCF bindings. This means that you can expose internal endpoints for your
service that can be used to integrate with on-premise applications and that you can expose
special endpoints to connect to the service bus. To host your service, you create an instance
of a ServiceHost, define your endpoints, and then open your server. You need to configure
the name of your service and the Default Key.

Microsoft recommends using the NetTcpRelayBinding unless you have other specific requirements.

Correct answers: A, D
A. Correct: The namespace is required to access your service. You specify the
namespace when creating your bindings and addresses.
B. Incorrect: The binding is specified at the host side for connecting to Azure Service
Bus. This is not something that you configure in the Management Portal.
C. Incorrect: ServiceHost is required to host your WCF service. It’s not something
that you configure in the Management Portal.
D. Correct: The Default Key is used for authentication both your server and client applications
to the service bus.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
78) You want to use a SharedSecretToken for authentication. Which method and parameters do you use?

A. TokenProvider.CreateSharedSecretTokenProvider(namespace, key)
B. TokenProvider.CreateSamlTokenProvider(samltoken)
C. TokenProvider.CreateSharedSecretTokenProvider(owner, key)
D. TokenProvider.CreateWindowsTokenProvider(uris)

BC

Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: You do need the CreateSharedSecretTokenProvider method. However,
you need to pass it the owner and key. The namespace is used in the service URI.
B. Incorrect: This method creates a SAML token.
C. Correct: CreateSharedSecretTokenProvider with the owner and key creates the
correct token.
D. Incorrect: This creates a Windows token.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
79) You want to connect a client to the service bus. Which elements do you need? 
(Choose all that apply.)

A. Namespace
B. Service path
C. Owner name
D. Default Key

ACD
When building a client to communicate with your relay, you need the namespace name
that you used for hosting the service and the default key. Using the name of your namespace, 
the owners name (default: owner), and the Default Key, you use a security mechanism that 
resembles the idea of a username and password.

Correct answers: A, B, C, D
A. Correct: The namespace is required to access your service. You specify the
namespace.
B. Correct: The service path is required as a part of your endpoint address.
C. Correct: The owner name is required when creating your SharedSecretToken.
D. Correct: The Default Key is also used for authentication and is required to create
your SharedSecretToken.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
80) You are building several WCF Services. You have several calls that are for logging
purposes only, and the application is known to be chatty. Responsiveness is critical,
and you need real-time responses for much of the application.

With this in mind, answer the following questions:

1. Do logging calls warrant the use of a different messaging pattern than other calls?

Several calls need real-time responses, logging does not require a real-time response. 
Hence you can use fire and forget to log information as shown in the method definition below.     

[OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]
void LogMessage(String messsage);

Logging calls are great candidates for OneWay implementation. The less important the
data is, the better candidate it is for a OneWay call. You lose the ability to have return
types on OneWay calls, but for logging operations, particularly ones that fire frequently,
if a few don’t make it to the server, it will likely have little impact. On the other
hand, the time it takes just to deal with a response type can exacerbate the problems
associated with chatty applications.

2. Why wouldn’t you just make everything employ duplex communication patterns?

Duplex communication occurs when a client connects to a service and provides the service with a channel on which the 
service can send messages back to the client.” In order for this to happen, all the communication must occur within the context of one session.
Regardless of whether duplexing is being implemented, a WCF Service needs a contract, and the contract requirement is handled by using an interface 
and the ServiceContract attribute. When using duplexing, an additional interface is required. This necessity entails a callback contract, and this 
contract must be specified in the service contract by way of the CallbackContract property.

Duplex communication is useful and, in some cases, it is the only option you have.
However, it is neither free nor cheap. Although WCF makes duplex communication appear
simple, quite a bit has to happen to make it work right. This happens largely out
of the user’s view, but it still happens. Implementing duplexing when it’s not needed
is the logical inverse of using a OneWay call. It adds overhead with no benefit and can
greatly hinder scalability. Although it’s powerful and useful, it should be used judiciously
and only when necessary.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
81) You have the following method signature. You are told that it should execute as quickly as possible and advised it would 
be a good candidate for a OneWay method. Which of the following are true (choose all that apply):

[OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]
Boolean LogMessage(String messsage);

A. This method is not a valid candidate to execute with the OneWay pattern because it has a return type.
B. This method is not a valid candidate to execute with the OneWay pattern because it accepts a parameter.
C. Simple logging operations that just accept a String parameter and return a Success or Failure message are 
ideally suited for the OneWay pattern. However, to work a Callback contract would be needed to work properly.
D. There’s not enough information to know for sure whether this method would be a good candidate to use to implement the OneWay pattern.

A

Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: Having a return type negates the use of the OneWay attribute.
B. Correct: OneWay can be used in conjunction with an input parameter.
C. Incorrect: Simple operations might be good candidates, but not if they return a
message.
D. Incorrect: The method has a return type that automatically disqualifies it.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
82) Your service needs to let clients open a channel to it and allow back and forth communication throughout the session. 
Which is true?

A. Any binding that supports streaming would be a work here.
B. Only bindings with the IsOneWay property set to true would be valid.
C. As long as the service can stream back to the client, this would work.
D. Duplex communication cannot be implemented with Http because it’s a stateful protocol.

D

Correct answers: A, C
A. Correct: Any binding that enables clients to open a channel with it and have backand-
forth communication would work here.
B. Incorrect: OneWay goes completely against the desired goal here.
C. Correct: As long as the service can call back to the client, it should work.
D. Incorrect: Http is a stateless protocol, so it can’t be used.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
83) Your service needs to support real-time communication between client and service. Which is true?

A. Streaming should be enabled.
B. A Binding that supports duplexing must be implemented.
C. A stateless protocol can be supported but the client must implement threading.
D. Duplexing and streaming must be implemented together.

B

Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: Streaming alone would not solve any of the stated problems.
B. Correct: Duplexing must be implemented, and as such, a binding that supports
duplexing must be enabled.
C. Incorrect: A stateless protocol by definition would be inadequate here, irrespective
of multi-threaded clients.
D. Incorrect: Duplexing alone suffices; there is no need for streaming.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
84) You are building several WCF Services. You know that you need to support Http,
TCP, and MSMQ. You expect a large number of clients and heavy loads on your
services. You might need to move the service host from machine to machine on
occasion. Additionally, all your developers are familiar with ASP.NET programming,
but are completely new to Windows Azure and WAS.

With this in mind, answer the following questions:

1. Is a console application or a WPF application implemented via self-hosting a viable approach?

No, Self-hosting is not a viable option, because self-hosting is unable to process 
a large amount of requests and does not support failover or immediate disaster recovery.    

There are several benefits of self-hosting, but simplicity has to be at the top of any list. 
Because you can easily swap out hosts, if you find that your application isn’t performing well, 
you can easily upgrade to another hosting mechanism. This option enables you to use a broad spectrum 
of bindings as well. It’s easy to move such a host application around from machine to machine and location 
to location. Additionally, because you can access the process without remote debugger privileges, you can 
easily debug the application and retrieve trace information from it.

Your self-host, on the other hand, will need to be debugged and tested thoroughly. If you find that you can’t support the load, 
moving to another machine or a major hardware upgrade is usually the only solution. You can’t just add nodes or easily implement 
load balancing. If your application crashes for whatever reason, it’s difficult to implement any sort of failover or immediate 
disaster recovery. For this reason, self-hosting is well suited to peer-to-peer applications and as the development host. 
It is generally a pretty underpowered choice for production services.

Self-hosting with a console or WPF application would most likely be the worst of the
possible approaches. Self-hosted services are easy to move from machine to machine,
and you can support each of the required bindings. However, heavy loads make it
a bad choice. The fact that most self-hosted services have to run under a dedicated
account makes it a bad choice. Someone could accidentally click the mouse over the
close button or erroneously hit an enter button and possibly shut down the entire host.

2. Is IIS a good candidate here, assuming that there are several instances available internally?

IIS limits the bindings you can use and support. IIS only supports message transport via HTTP. 
As you might recall from the discussion on bindings, the http-based binding set is easy to use, 
but it’s also quite limiting, and because you can use only HTTP, it makes this option unusable for many.

IIS would be a great choice except for one major issue: It simply doesn’t support any of
the bindings other than HTTP, so it clearly wouldn’t work here. The fact that developers
are familiar with it and that it scales well is irrelevant because of the bindings issue.

3. What factors shift the equation to one host choice versus another?

The host must be able to process a large amount of requests (by using for example load balancing) and support failover or immediate disaster recovery.  
Furtheremore the host must support multiple protocols Http, TCP, and MSMQ. 

Windows Azure might be a decent approach, although the fact that the developers
are unfamiliar with it would necessitate them gaining that expertise quickly. That’s not
a huge hurdle, but it is a hurdle nonetheless. WAS supports all the bindings needed.
The services can move from one WAS instance to another with relative ease; in fact,
the move could even be scripted. WAS on Windows Azure could meet all the criteria,
but internally hosted WAS would seem in this case to be the most appropriate hosting choice.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
85) You are developing a new WCF Service. Each time a client initiates a request, you need
to create a service instance to support it. What should you do?

A. Set the InstanceContextMode to Singleton.
B. Set the ConcurrencyMode to PerCall.
C. Set the InstanceContextMode to PerCall.
D. Set the ConcurrencyMode’s scope to User and set the InstanceContextMode to PerCall. 

C

The InstanceContextMode setting is another critical item that has a significant impact on the behavior of the service. 
This setting specifies the number of service instances available for handling calls to the service.
PerCall: This setting creates one instance (or more) for each client request.

Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: There’s no Singleton enumeration value but even if there was, it would
make no sense here.
B. Incorrect: ConcurrencyMode doesn’t have a PerCall value.
C. Correct: InstanceContextMode needs to be set to PerCall to work.
D. Incorrect: There is no way to set the ConcurrencyMode’s scope to User.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
86) Which of the following would be appropriate as a WCF Service Host?

A. Correct: A hosted workflow service has an appDomain and an entry point, so it
would work.
B. Correct: A Managed Windows Service has an entry point and is an ideal candidate
as a host.
C. Correct: A console application has an entry point and would work fine in this
scenario.
D. Correct: IIS is well suited to WCF hosting.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
87) You need to develop a WCF Service. The service is supposed to be both self-hosted
and discoverable by any client application. Which of the following are needed to support
this scenario? (Choose all that apply.)

A. A DiscoveryEndpoint
B. A ServiceHost definition
C. A ServiceBehavior definition
D. A UpdDiscoveryEndpoint

AB

Correct answers: A, B
A. Correct: A DiscoveryEndpoint would be necessary to meet the discovery
requirement.
B. Correct: Without a servicehost definition, it would be impossible to create this application
as a self-hosted service.
C. Incorrect: A ServiceBehavior definition might be beneficial, but it’s not required as
the item is stated.
D. Incorrect: While a DiscoveryEndpoint is necessary to meet the application requirements,
there is no need for a UdpDiscoveryEndpoint specifically.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
88) You are explaining Web API to your colleagues. You think it’s a nice and elegant solution,
but they don’t see the advantages of Web API over Windows Communication
Foundation (WCF). They come with up with the following questions:

1. Why should we depend on HTTP verbs instead of calling a method by name?

The advantage of using HTTP verbs is that most client applications support the HTTP protocol, and hence
are able to call the Web service using the HTTP protocol. Calling a method by name requires a dedicated WCF-client, 
which is not as widely used as the HTTP protocol.           

By using the HTTP verbs, you use HTTP as the foundation of your service. The HTTP
verbs are supported by browser and by the HttpClient and by all other platforms.
This way, you can use a single URL and use the verb to specify what action you want
to take. This decouples the client code from implementation details such as method
names.

2. What’s the advantage of content negotiation? Isn’t the service the one that should declare the return type?

Content negotiation uses media-type formatters to return the requested format to a client.
Content negotiation increases the flexibility of your web service. Depending on the acception type of the web client calling the web service, 
the web service can send back an answer in for example json, XML or another type.

By using content negotiation, you don’t couple your service to a specific technology.
Instead, you support multiple clients, all with their own requirements. The clients can
then choose the format to work with.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
89) You have been asked to create an ASP.NET Web API application. The current site enables users to post comments on newly posted articles. 
There’s been an increasing problem of inappropriate and spam comments. Editors need to be able to edit the inappropriate content after reviewing 
it and finding it in violation with the terms of service. Editors also need to be able to permanently delete any comments that are considered spam. 
Which operations accomplish these goals? (Choose all that apply.)

A. HttpGet
B. HttpPost
C. HttpDelete
D. HttpPut

CD (Update the content using HttpPut, and delete the content using HttpDelete), maybe (if read functionality is not standard provided)
in order to read the posts the editor needs access to HttpGet 

Correct answers: A, C, D
A. Correct: HttpGet requests are necessary to view the data to moderate it.
B. Incorrect: HttpPost is used to add new items. Editors don’t need to add new items
(but users do).
C. Correct: Deletions should be done through the HttpDelete operation.
D. Correct: HttpPut can be used for modifying posts.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
90) You have an ASP.NET MVC Web API that processes new customer inquiries. The client applications are intended to be very focused in scope and centered 
on just a few operations. A decision was just made that, for now, the API needs to simply allow data collected from a Web Form to be submitted to a SQL 
Server database. Which of the following is needed to allow form data to be submitted to the server?

A. HttpGet
B. HttpHead
C. HttpPost
D. HttpPut

C

Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: HttpGet should be used only to retrieve data, not to insert it.
B. Incorrect: HttpHead can be used to retrieve information about the request, but
not to insert records.
C. Correct: To insert a new record, the HttpPost operation should be called.
D. Incorrect: The HttpPut operation should be used for modifying data. HttpPost is a
better candidate for inserting data.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
91) Your ASP.NET Web API application needs to be able to allow action methods to operate through multiple HTTP Actions (namely HttpPost and HttpPut). 
How should this be accomplished?

A. Decorate the method with both the HttpGet and the HttpPost attribute.
B. Decorate the method with an HttpGet and an HttpPut attribute.
C. Decorate the method with the ActionNames attribute using the values of HttpPut and HttpPost.
D. Decorate the method with the AcceptVerbs attributes, including HttpPut and HttpPost.

D

Correct answer: D
A. Incorrect: HttpPost and HttpPut need to be implemented here; an HttpGet does
not solve the core requirement. You also need to use the AcceptVerbs attribute to
allow multiple verbs to be used.
B. Incorrect: HttpPost and HttpPut need to be implemented here; an HttpGet does
not solve the core requirement. You also need to use the AcceptVerbs attribute to
allow multiple verbs to be used.
C. Incorrect: The operations are correct but need to be implemented with the
AcceptVerbs attribute.
D. Correct: The AcceptVerbs attribute should be implemented as indicated here, and
both the HttpPut and HttpPost operation should be supported.

103) You are the architect and lead developer on a new project. You are going to build
the back end for a new app. The app will be used by health care services to track
patient records. Depending on the access privileges of the users, they can view and
edit patient status, such as notes and images like x-rays or other scans. To support
the bring-your-own-device policy, the app will be distributed to a multitude of
devices running on Windows, Windows Phone, iOS, and Android, and on the web.
You already have two hospitals with thousands of staff members who are going to
beta test your app.

1. Why is Web API well-suited for this scenario?

You can use the Http protocol to make the data available to a wide range of WebClients (or Custom made clients) 
running on different OS.      

All devices are capable of executing web requests. By using Web API, you open your
service to all devices that you want to support.

2. Are you planning to use any of the following techniques?
■■ Content negotiation
■■ HttpMessageHandler
■■ Dependency injection
■■ Action filters
■■ Streaming

Content negotiation, return Json or XML data to client depending on it accept type.
HttpMessageHandler, you can for example add audit functionality to monitor who is requesting which information.  
Dependency injection, you can use an injected Repository to access patient data, this make the software more clean, easy to change dependency      
Action filters can be used for logging (When entering or exiting the action method) or audit functionality to monitor action calls.    
Streaming can be used when you need to send a large amount of data to a client such as X-Rays or NMR recordings. You use the PushStreamContent class to stream data.

The following explains what you should use:
■■ Through content-negotiation, all clients can work with data in a format that’s suitable
for the device. It’s one of the foundational features of Web API.
■■ You can use an HttpMessageHandler if you have any cross-cutting concerns that
should apply to all requests or to specific routes. At this moment, you have no use
for handlers, but that could change.
■■ Dependency injection is an important part of each modern architecture. You can
use it to create a loosely coupled system that can easily be unit tested.
■■ You should use the AuthorizeAttribute, which is an implementation of an action filter.
You can also create your own attributes if you want to run code before or after
an action runs.
■■ Streaming is important because you are supporting thousands of users, and you
need to transmit large amounts of data for the images.

106) You want to create an attribute that executes when an exception happens anywhere in
your application. Which steps do you take? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Inherit from ActionFilterAttribute.
B. Inherit from ExceptionFilterAttribute.
C. Add the custom attribute to your controllers.
D. Add the custom attribute to HttpConfiguration.Filters.

BD 

Correct answers: B, D
A. Incorrect: For exception handling, you shouldn’t inherit from ActionFilterAttribute.
Those filters execute on each request, independently of an exception happening.
B. Correct: ExceptionFilterAttribute is the correct base class for filters that should
execute whenever an exception happens.
C. Incorrect: Adding the attribute to all your controllers is error prone. Instead, you
can apply the attribute globally.
D. Correct: By adding the attribute to the global collection of filters, you apply it to
all controllers and action methods in one step.

107) You are working on a Web API that will store stats for a new game that you will
release as an app for various platforms and as a web application. Users first need to
register before they can play games and share their achievements with other users.

1. Can you use Windows Authentication?

No, because you need to use Kerberos, or NTLM or use Windows active directory.  
Windows Authentication enables users to be authenticated using their Windows login credentials, Kerberos, or NTLM.
Windows Authentication is easy to use from both a client and server perspective, but it has
clearly defined boundaries that might immediately exclude it as an authentication mechanism.

No. Windows Authentication is not suited for consumer-facing applications. It should
be used for intranet applications.

2. Do you need to protect yourself against XSRF?

Yes, after authentication, the credentials could be stored in a cookie, hence they are available in case of XSRF attack.      
Note that native applications that send the user credentials on each request are not vulnerable for XSRF attacks on your Web API. 
Only browser-based clients that cache user credentials are vulnerable.

Yes. Because you are storing user credentials in a cookie for the web application, your
application is vulnerable for XSRF attacks.

3. Is CORS important for your back end?

Yes because the web application needs to access the Web API that will store stats for the new game.   
 
No, because your back end won’t be called by other websites through AJAX, CORS is not
important. Only when you have AJAX calls coming from other origins should you enable CORS.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
108) You want to enable HTTPS for your Web API, and you want to make sure that none of
the developers forgets about this requirement. How do you do this?

A. Create a custom ApiController base class from which all developers need to inherit.
B. Create an HttpsRequiredAttribute and add it to each controller.
C. Create an HttpsRequiredAttribute and add it to the global collection of attributes.
D. Use MakeCert.exe to create an HTTPS certificate.

C

Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: Developers can forget to inherit from the custom controller. This is no
safe way to implement the requirement.
B. Incorrect: If a developer forgets to add the attribute to a controller, the controller
will be accessible through HTTP.
C. Correct: Adding the attribute to the global collection of attributes makes sure that
it is automatically applied to all controllers.
D. Incorrect: MakeCert is used to create a test certificate that you can use on your
development machine. It doesn’t force your application to HTTPS.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
109) You are building a Web API to be used by third-party websites, and you want to reach as many users as possible. 
You want to protect your service from XSRF attacks. Which requirement do you state for your third parties?

A. Force them to use ASP.NET MVC so you can easily authenticate requests.
B. Require them to include both a cookie and a form value with a unique token.
C. Use the ValidateAntiForgeryToken attribute on your Web API service.
D. Use Windows Authentication.

(B?)C

Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: Forcing your customers to use ASP.NET MVC to develop their websites
doesn’t increase your user base. This is not something you can state as a requirement
in the real world.
B. Correct: This is the basic idea behind the antiforgery token solution that ASP.NET
MVC offers. By comparing the two values, you can validate the request origin.
C. Incorrect: ValidateAntiForgeryToken can be used only with ASP.NET MVC.
D. Incorrect: Windows Authentication isn’t possible with a consumer-facing
application.

110) You want to extend the default authentication mechanism of Web API. You want to have an attribute that 
you can place on a couple of action methods to log nonauthenticated requests. What do you do?

A. Inherit from IAuthorizationFilter to implement the custom logic.
B. Inherit from AuthorizeAttribute to implement the custom logic.
C. Inherit from AuthorizeFilterAttribute to implement the custom logic.
D. Create an HttpMessageHandler that you attach to specific routes.

B, Override protected virtual void HandleUnauthorizedRequest (System.Web.Mvc.AuthorizationContext filterContext);

Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: IAuthorizationFilter is a very low-level interface. You should inherit from
this interface only if you have any asynchronous work that doesn’t involve the current
user or role.
B. Correct: By inheriting from this attribute, you get a fully implemented authorization
attribute that you can easily extend.
C. Incorrect: You should extend this class only to perform synchronous authorization
logic that is not necessarily based on the current user or role.
D. Incorrect: It’s easier to inherit from the AuthorizeAttribute. By directly adding the
attribute to specific methods, you can control when to run the code.

116) You are considering a deployment strategy for a web service that will be the back
end of a new app you will deploy worldwide on multiple platforms. Because of your
requirements, you will use WCF to create your back end. You are planning to build
your app in successive iterations that will expand the functionality. You also expect
that your user load will increase when your app gains popularity.
With this in mind, answer the following questions:

1. How can Windows Azure help you with the hosting of your back end?

It is expected that the user load will increase when the app gains popularity.
Windows Azure allows you to easily scale up the resources of the WCF back end.
In summary, Windows Azure makes it more easy to scale up web services and handle more user requests.     

A WCF Service can easily be deployed to Windows Azure. Because of the expected
increase in users, Windows Azure is a good choice. Instead of buying big servers upfront
to host the potential user load that you will get, you can start small and pay only
for the resources you need. As your application starts growing, you can increase the
capacity you have inside Windows Azure. This is a cost-effective way of hosting your
application.

2. Why should you plan for continuous deployment?

The plan is to build the app in successive iterations that will expand the functionality. 
Using this strategy, you want to deliver a new product after each iteration (adding new functionality).  
By using continuous deployment, you continuously deliver new releases after changes have been made to the software.
The software is build and tested and ready to be deployed in production.   

Because you are planning to expand the functionality of your application, it is wise to
have a deployment process in place in which you can quickly update your application.
Setting up a continuous deployment environment takes some time, but will make life
easier when you start releasing updates for your application.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
117) You need to deploy an application that requires some changes to the registry. 
Which deployment strategy do you use?

A. Copy the website.
B. FTP client.
C. Web Deploy.
D. A web farm.

C

Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: The Copy Website option can be used only to deploy the files of an application.
You can’t make any modifications to the registry.
B. Incorrect: With an FTP client, you can copy your files to the server. However, you
can’t make any changes to the registry.
C. Correct: Web Deploy enables you to use a provider that can make changes to the
registry while deploying your application.
D. Incorrect: A web farm is a description of how you will host your application. It’s
not a deployment technique.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
118) You are planning to deploy your application to an on-premises web farm. You use session
state to store some user data. Which session state mode do you use? (Choose all that apply.)

A. InProc
B. StateServer
C. Off
D. SQL Server

BD

Correct answers: B, D
A. Incorrect: The InProc mode does not work in a web farm. Servers store the session
data in memory, which makes it unavailable for other servers.
B. Correct: Storing your data in a separate StateServer makes it available to all servers
in the web farm.
C. Incorrect: Turning session state off is only an option when your application
doesn’t use any session state at all.
D. Correct: Storing your data in a separate SQL Server makes it available to all servers
in the web farm.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
119) You want to adopt a continuous deployment strategy. Which elements are important? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Build server
B. Unit tests
C. Integration tests
D. A web farm

ABC

Correct answers: A, B, C
A. Correct: Having a Build Server that tests your code and then executes a deployment
is required.
B. Correct: Unit tests are a part of continuous integration. They test your code in an
automatic way so you can find bugs before deploying your code.
C. Correct: Integration tests test your application in a more elaborate way than unit
tests. Together with unit tests, they are important for automatic testing of your
application.
D. Incorrect: A web farm is not required to have a continuous deployment strategy.
Even if you have a single server or are using the cloud, you can automatically
deploy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
120) You are planning the deployment of your Web API and you are looking at the vari-ous options you have. 
You are looking at self-hosting, hosting in IIS on your own server, and hosting on Windows Azure Websites. 

1. What are the pros and cons for self-hosting?

You create the hosting application (console,wpf ...), this could introduce errors. If you for example  
choose to use IIS to host your web service, you know that IIS is battle tested and is well supported in case of error. 

Self-hosting is really easy to set up. You can use it for things such as integration tests or
for hosting your Web API on a server that doesn’t have IIS installed. However, ASP.NET
hosting offers you all the mature features that IIS has, which is a big plus.

2. If you choose to use IIS, do you want to use an on premise IIS or Windows Azure Websites?

It depends on the TCO (total cost of ownership), and the scaling requirements in the short and long term.  
By hosting your Web API in Windows Azure, you get all the benefits of Windows Azure, such as scalability 
and availability, without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

Windows Azure Websites has the big advantage of completely outsourcing the infrastructure.
You get a robust infrastructure with easy scalability options. You pay only for
what you use. However, an on-premises server is totally under your control. Sometimes
this is a requirement for data security.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
121) Which of the following items must be provided to use the self-host option? (Choose all that apply.)

A. AspnetSelfHostConfiguration
B. HttpSelfHostConfiguration
C. AspnetSelfHostServer
D. HttpSelfHostServer 

BD

Correct answers: B, D
A. Incorrect: AspNetSelfHostConfiguration does not exist and is not a valid option.
B. Correct: HttpSelfHostConfiguration is one of the two required classes needed to
self-host.
C. Incorrect: AspNetSelfHostServer does not exist and is not a valid option.
D. Correct: HttpSelfHostServer is the second of the two required classes needed to
self-host.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
122) You are changing the hosting of your Web API to use a Windows Service. Originally, the configuration was automatically 
generated by the Visual Studio template. What do you need to do to make this work?

A. Nothing; the existing configuration will work.
B. Copy the existing configuration to a new class in the host project.
C. Add a new class of type HttpSelfHostConfiguration. Use the Initialize method to call the MapHttpRoute method.
D. Add a new class of type HttpSelfHostConfiguration. Use the Routes property to call the MapHttpRoute method.

D

Correct answer: D
A. Incorrect: Without specifying a configuration, the host will not operate correctly.
You need the HttpSelfHostConfiguration class to start the host and set up the api
route.
B. Incorrect: As it stands, a copy of the existing configuration does not work because
the HttpSelfHostConfiguration class needs to be used.
C. Incorrect: Although the HttpSelfHostConfiguration should be used, the Routes
property is what you use to access the MapHttpRoute method.
D. Correct: The Routes property on the HttpSelfHostConfiguration class has the
MapHttpRoute method necessary to configure Routes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
123) You are working for a large company that has a lot of maintenance engineers on the
road. You are going to develop an app to support their work remotely with publicly
available data. You are looking at your deployment options. You know the app will be
used during office times. Throughout the day, you will have five thousand users of your
service. What deployment option do you choose?

A. You buy extra servers for your on-premise data center.
B. You use Azure Cloud Services to host your Web API as a Web Role.
C. You use Azure websites.
D. You deploy Azure Virtual Machines to host your Web API.

When deploying to Windows Azure, you have three options:
■■ Windows Azure Websites
■■ Windows Azure Cloud Services
■■ Windows Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)

C
Windows Azure Websites enable you to create highly scalable websites quickly. You don’t
need to learn a new application model or manage machines. If you don’t have specialized
requirements that require you to use cloud services or VMs, Windows Azure Websites is a
great choice.

Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: Because your data is publicly available, you don’t face any security issues
when moving your service to the cloud. Because you have a fluctuating user
load, the elasticity of the cloud can help you. Deploying to Azure websites is the
easiest solution.
B. Incorrect: Cloud Services are an option, but because you are only deploying a
Web API service, it’s much easier to use Azure websites.
C. Correct: Azure websites saves a lot of time and cost upfront. Because you pay
for each minute you use, you can save costs by scaling your service down outside
office times. When you have a high user load, you can automatically add extra
servers to make sure your service performs.
D. Incorrect: Azure virtual machines require you to manage all servers yourself. You
get the hardware from Azure, but it still requires configuring and updating your
operating systems. Azure websites is a much easier solution to host a Web API.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
124) You are integrating with a third-party Web API service. The service enables you to
execute CRUD operations to work with time records.

1. How can you map the HttpClient methods to the standard CRUD operations?
All operations (Get, Post, Put, Delete, and more) are supported by the HttpClient class.
You can use the corresponding CRUD call, HttpClient.PostAsync(Create), HttpClient.GetAsync((Read), 
HttpClient.PutAsync(Update) and HttpClient.DeleteAsync(Delete)   

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete. Create can be done with Post, Read
with Get, Update with Put, and Delete with the Delete verb.

2. Why is it useful to create classes that map to the return values of the service?

Data returned from a Web Service is serialized in the form of json, xml or some other format.
In order to convert it to objects we need to deserialize the return values of the service    
In order to deserialize the data we need classes that map to the return values of the service,
so we can use objects in the application instead of Json or XML values.  

This way, you don’t have to work with raw JSON or XML data. By deserializing the
results to classes, you can easily use them in the rest of your code.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
125) The HttpClient class you have implemented frequently receives error codes, but the application is not responding to them. What should you do?

A. Trap the OnError event of the request.
B. Set the EnsureSuccessStatusCode property to true and implement an exception handler in the OnError event.
C. Call the EnsureSuccessStatusCode method and trap the HttpRequestException exception.
D. Check the ResultStatusCode property and throw an exception if one of the error values is present. 

C
Note you can also check the StatusCode from the HttpWebResponse as shown below. 

public static void GetPage(String url)
{
	try
	{	
            // Creates an HttpWebRequest for the specified URL.
            HttpWebRequest myHttpWebRequest = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(url);
            // Sends the HttpWebRequest and waits for a response.
            HttpWebResponse myHttpWebResponse = (HttpWebResponse)myHttpWebRequest.GetResponse();
            if (myHttpWebResponse.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.OK)
               Console.WriteLine("\r\nResponse Status Code is OK and StatusDescription is: {0}",
                                    myHttpWebResponse.StatusDescription);
            // Releases the resources of the response.
            myHttpWebResponse.Close();
    }
    catch(WebException e)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("\r\nWebException Raised. The following error occurred : {0}",e.Status);
	}
    catch(Exception e)
    {
		Console.WriteLine("\nThe following Exception was raised : {0}",e.Message);
    }
}
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.httpwebresponse.statuscode?view=netcore-3.1

Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: There is no OnError event, so trapping it would not work.
B. Incorrect: The EnsureSuccessStatusCode is a method, not a property. You also
need to catch an exception directly with a try/catch statement.
C. Correct: The EnsureSuccessStatusCode method should be called, and an exception
should be trapped of type HttpRequestException.
D. Incorrect: Checking the status code would work, but you would need to check
each value in the range of 500–599. The EnsureSuccessStatusCode method is a
better way to do this.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
126) You need to create a custom media type for vCards. The media formatter needs to access an XML file to get the format for 
specific vCards. What should you do? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Create a formatter using the MediaTypeFormatter class.
B. Create a formatter using the BufferedMediaTypeFormatter class.
C. Add the formatter to each request at the client.
D. Add the formatter to the Web API configuration on the server.

ABD
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/formats-and-model-binding/media-formatters

Correct answers: A, D
A. Correct: You should inherit from the MediaTypeFormatter class if you want to
execute any I/O or other asynchronous operation.
B. Incorrect: You should use the MediaTypeFormatter base class so you can implement
asynchronous I/O.
C. Incorrect: The formatter should be added to the server configuration.
D. Correct: You activate the formatter by adding it to the global Web API configuration
on the server.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
127) You have multiple HttpClient calls that can run independently of each other. You want to execute them as fast as possible. What should you do?

A. Use the Result property of each HttpClient call to get the result as fast as possible.
B. Use async/await to make sure that the calls run asynchronously.
C. Use Task.WaitAll to execute the tasks in parallel.
D. You can’t execute asynchronous tasks in parallel. 

C
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task.waitall?view=netcore-3.1
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task.whenall?view=netcore-3.1

Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: Using the Result property blocks the asynchronous call until it’s finished.
This is not the fastest way.
B. Incorrect: Although it runs the requests asynchronously, it doesn’t run them in
parallel.
C. Correct: Task.WaitAll can be used to run multiple asynchronous requests in
parallel.
D. Incorrect: This is not true. Although async/await doesn’t execute requests in
parallel, you can do this by using other features of the Task Parallel Library such as
Task.WaitAll.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
128) Your company distributes a cloud service with multiple worker and web roles. A new
update will soon be available, and you are considering the different options you
have for updating the cloud service. With this in mind, answer the following questions:

1. What is the difference between VIP Swap and in-place upgrade?
An in-place upgrade means that Windows Azure will update your instances according
to the upgrade domain they belong to. This way, you won’t have
any downtime on your service. However, this can lead to running multiple versions of
your service at the same time. This is something you need to take into account. If, 
for example, your database schema also changed, you can get runtime errors when your 
old instances are trying to access the database. To overcome this problem, you can 
use a different technique called VIP Swap.

A Windows Azure cloud service has two environments: production and staging. 
Both environments offer the same hardware, but they have different virtual IP 
(VIP) and service URLs. Because the staging and production environment are identical, 
you can perform what’s known as a VIP Swap. A cloud service can be deployed to both a 
staging and a production environment. A VIP Swap brings your staging environment into 
production and your production environment to staging.

With an in-place upgrade, you update your instances according to update domains.
This will give you zero downtime.

2. Which one do you prefer? Why?

I prefer VIP Swap, because when using in-place upgrade you can have two different versions in production (The old and the new version) 
which can lead to errors in case your database schema also changed.   

With a VIP Swap, you promote your staging environment to production (and change
your production environment to staging). A VIP Swap has the advantage of mitigating
the risk of bringing multiple versions of your application into production at the same
time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
129) You are deploying a new cloud service with only a web role, and you want to make
sure that you get the maximum guaranteed uptime, even during upgrades. How many
instances do you need?

A. 1
B. 2
C. 3
D. 4

B
You need at least two instances spread across two fault domains to have maximum availability guaranteed by Windows Azure.

Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: The Windows Azure Service Level Agreement says that you must have
two or more role instances in different fault and upgrade domains, so one instance
is not enough.
B. Correct: The Windows Azure Service Level Agreement says that you must have
two or more role instances in different fault and upgrade domains.
C. Incorrect: The Windows Azure Service Level Agreement says that you must have
two or more role instances in different fault and upgrade domains. If you don’t
need three instances for performance, it is not necessary to deploy more than two
instances.
D. Incorrect: The Windows Azure Service Level Agreement says that you must have
two or more role instances in different fault and upgrade domains. If you don’t
need four instances for performance, it is not necessary to deploy more than two
instances.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
130) You want to be able to communicate directly from your web role to your worker role,
and you want to make sure that your worker role stays secure by disallowing public
access. What do you do?

A. Add an InputEndpoint to the web role in your ServiceConfiguration.cscfg file.
B. Add an InputEndpoint to your worker role in your ServiceConfiguration.cscfg file.
C. Add an InternalEndPoint to the web role in your ServiceConfiguration.cscfg file.
D. Add an InternalEndPoint to your worker role in your ServiceConfiguration.cscfg file.

C
Windows Azure helps you secure your roles by using strict rules that are enforced by settings in the firewall and in the operating system that hosts your role.
You can use both input endpoints and internal endpoints. An input endpoint is used for external connections to your role. These connections can be made over 
HTTP, HTTPS, or TCP. Internal endpoints are used for communication between the roles in the datacenter in which they are located. These internal endpoints can use HTTP and TCP.

Correct answer: D
A. Incorrect: You should add an InternalEndPoint to your worker role. By adding
extra endpoints to your web role, you don’t enable communication to your worker
role.
B. Incorrect: You shouldn’t add a public InputEndpoint to your worker. This will make
your worker accessible from outside your cloud service. Instead, you should add an
InternalEndPoint.
C. Incorrect: You should add an InternalEndPoint to your worker role. By adding
extra endpoints to your web role, you don’t enable communication to your worker
role.
D. Correct: An InternalEndPoint to your worker role enables communication from the
web role to the worker role.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
131) You want to follow the recommended best practices for configuring your Windows
Azure Guest OS. Which values do you use? (Choose all that apply.)

A. osFamily=”3”
B. osFamily=”1”
C. osVersion=”*”
D. osVersion=”WA-GUEST-OS-2.12_201208-02”

C
The osVersion attribute is used to specify the version of the guest OS that your role should run. You can set this value to * if you want to run on the newest version. 
This enables automatic upgrades and is a recommended best practice.

Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: This specifies a fixed version of your OS. You should use an asterisk (*)
to make sure you always get all updates.
B. Incorrect: A value of 1 specifies one of the older Guest OSs.
C. Correct: By using *, you don’t depend on a specific version. You get automatic
updates to your Guest OS.
D. Incorrect: You shouldn’t depend on a specific version. This disables automatic
updates.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
132) You are creating a complex web application that will be deployed to multiple,
on-premises servers. You are working with development, testing, acceptance, and
production environments; and you want to automate your deployment as much as possible.

With this in mind, answer the following questions:

1. Which configuration do you want to release to each of your different environments?

In the testing environment you want to use the Debug configuration of your application, 
using this configuration you can retrieve debug info in case of errors.
When you compile an application in debug mode, extra instructions are added to your compiled
code. This ensures that debugging is supported, and that you can easily step through your code with a debugger.
In the acceptance and production environments you use the release configuration,
the application is then optimized for speed and does not contain debug information    

On your development and test environments, you can use a debug configuration. This
way, you can more easily debug your code and find errors. Acceptance and production
want to use the release configuration. If you want more granular control, you can also
add extra configurations for your environments.

2. Do you want to use Web.config transformations or parameters with Web Deploy for your deployment pipeline?

I would use Web Deploy with parameters because it allows deployment of more complex web applications.   
If you want to create one Web Deploy package and then deploy it to multiple locations, you can use parameterization.
Web Deploy can use parameters to specify which values in your configuration can
be changed during installation. By using a SetParameters.xml file, you can define the values you want to use.

Because you know beforehand to which environments you are going to deploy, it is
easier to use Web.config transformations. Depending on the environment you work in,
you might need to deploy the same DLL that passed quality control to production. This
would require you to use parameterization to account for the differences between the
environments.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
133) You want to deploy your ASP.NET MVC application to your own web server for production.
Which steps do you take? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Change the debug attribute of the web.config to false.
B. Build a release configuration.
C. Disable the ASP.NET debugger in the Debuggers section of your project properties.
D. Build a debug configuration.

AB (Not C because The enabled debuggers work only when your code is compiled with debugging information.)

Correct answers: A, B
A. Correct: By setting the debug attribute to false (or removing it), you enable certain
optimizations that you want to use on your production environment.
B. Correct: A release configuration has better performance and should be used in a
production environment.
C. Incorrect: The selected debuggers don’t affect performance when there is no
debug information in the assemblies. You don’t have to explicitly turn them off.
D. Incorrect: A debug configuration has a slower performance than a release configuration
and should not be used for a production environment.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
134) You want to remove your debug element from the web.config file by using web.config
transformations. Which syntax do you use?

A. <compilation xdt:Transform=”Replace” />
B. <compilation xdt:Transform=”RemoveAttributes(debug)” xdt:Locator=”Condition(@debug=’true’)” />
C. <compilation xdt:Transform=”RemoveAttributes(debug)” xdt:Locator=”Match(name)” />
D. <compilation xdt:Transform=”RemoveAttributes(debug)” /> 

C

Correct answer: D
A. Incorrect: You don’t want to completely replace the compilation element. If this
element contains other values, you want to remove only the debug attribute.
B. Incorrect: You don’t need the locator attribute. Without a locator attribute, Web
Deploy matches your element to the existing element in web.config.
C. Incorrect: You don’t need the locator attribute. Without a locator attribute, Web
Deploy matches your element to the existing element in web.config. Matching on
name makes no sense because the compilation element doesn’t have a name.
D. Correct: You remove the debug attribute from the compilation element.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
135) You are using parameters for your Web Deploy. You want to automate the creation of
the SetParameters file and make sure that it has the correct values. What do you use?

A. XmlPoke with MSDeploy.
B. MSDeploy with the setParamFile attribute.
C. XmlPoke with MSBuild.
D. This is not possible. You need to edit the SetParameters file manually.

C
Changing the SetParameters.xml file by hand each time is not what you want if you run in
an automated environment. If you want to automate changing the values for setParameters in
your build process, you can use something called XmlPoke. XmlPoke is an MSBuild task that
you can run during your build process.

Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: XmlPoke is an MSBuild Task, not an MSDeploy parameter.
B. Incorrect: The setParamFile is used to supply a Parameters.xml file that’s used for
parameterization. You will still have to edit the SetParameters.xml file.
C. Correct: XmlPoke is an MSBuild task that you can use to edit XML files in an automated
way.
D. Incorrect: By using MSBuild with the XmlPoke task, you can edit your SetParameters
automatically.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
136) You are working in a small company that runs a lot of web development projects
each year. Each time you start a new project, you evaluate the current state of
technologies and you try to use the newest technologies available. However, your
colleagues feel that they want control over what gets used in all the projects. You
are thinking of introducing NuGet to them and you are trying to prepare a good
argument. With this in mind, answer the following questions:

1. Are you still in control over what gets added to your project when using NuGet? Is that an advantage or a disadvantage?

You can inspect the dependencies of a NuGet and decide whether you want to install it or not.   
So you are in control over what gets added to your project, you can decide to install the NuGet.   

Packages can contain all types of content. Some packages consist of a set of assemblies that are automatically
referenced when you add them to your project. Others contain JavaScript and CSS files
that are added to the correct folders in your project. Other packages modify your web.config
file or add code to your project. One big advantage of using NuGet to install a package is 
that it automatically detects any required dependencies and installs them together with your package. 
This way, you never have to manually search for any dependencies or other prerequisites. This is all 
taken care of for you by NuGet.

You can see all the changes that NuGet made, but you are not totally in control anymore.
NuGet downloads any dependencies for your package automatically. NuGet
can also make changes to your configuration files and add code and other files to your
project. However, this is not a disadvantage because NuGet makes only the changes
that you had to make manually.

2. How can NuGet help you stay on the cutting edge of new releases?

The NuGet gallery contains all packages that are currently available, 
and also contains packages that use the newest technologies available, 
this offers you a wealth of potentially useful packages that you can use
in your own projects.

NuGet offers a simple way to update your packages to new releases. You can even use
NuGet to download prerelease packages.

3. Would it be useful to create your own package repository?

Yes, you can then create custom Visual Studio templates that use the best practices of 
your development team and reference your company’s packages that are hosted on your own 
feed, so everyone starts with the correct baseline.

If you don’t want to create custom packages or keep a local cache of packages, this is
not necessary.

140) You are planning an internal presentation for your colleagues to show them the
benefits of automating your deployment. Currently, you are doing manual deployments
in which you just copy the required files through FTP to the target servers.
Database updates are always done manually.
With this in mind, answer the following questions:

1. What are the advantages that continuous deployment can give you? Make a list.

You can easily deploy a new release in an automated way. 

Because continuous deployment decreases your feedback cycle, you get much quicker
feedback on your application. You can respond to customer demand more quickly. In
the current world in which agile is the norm, this is definitely a requirement for most, if
not all, applications.

2. Which techniques do you need for this?

You can use Web Deploy, you can create and deploy a Web Deploy package through Visual Studio, the IIS, command
line, and Windows PowerShell. 

Because you are using multiple servers and databases, Web Deploy is the best choice.
By using the command line or Windows PowerShell tools, you can integrate with your
build process and automatically update your servers. If you are using the Entity Framework,
you can use automatic migrations. Otherwise, you can use one of the other
techniques such as dbDacFx or dbFullSql.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
144) You are building a library that will contain some utility code. The idea is that the
library can be shared by multiple web applications that you are developing.
With this in mind, answer the following questions:

1. Why should you sign your assembly?

It secures the assembly, you know who signed it, furthermore you need to sign an assembly in order to register it in the GAC.      

■■ Strong names guarantee uniqueness. Your unique private key is used to generate the name for your assembly. No other assembly can have the exact same strong name.
■■ Strong names protect your versioning lineage. Because you control the private key, you are the only one who can distribute updates to your assemblies. Users can be sure that the new version originates from the same publisher.
■■ Strong names provide a strong integrity check. The .NET Framework sees whether a strong-named assembly has changed since the moment it was signed.

Signing the assembly protects the assembly against tampering. The .NET Framework
will check that the assembly hasn’t been altered between signing and running. Signing
is also a requirement to be able to use a digital certificate, so users of your application
will know that you are the publisher of the application. A disadvantage could be that
you can no longer reference other unsigned assemblies. If you own these assemblies,
you can sign them yourself. If not, you have to ask their publisher to sign them.

2. What is the advantage of interning your assembly?

All shared assemblies are loaded only once in memory. This
decreases both memory usage and startup time of your websites.
ASP.NET 4.5 adds a new feature called assembly interning. Because all DLLs are already
located in one location (the Temporary ASP.NET Files folder), interning analyzes this folder
for duplicate assemblies. Those assemblies are then moved to a special location, and all the
original references are replaced with what’s called a symbolic link.
When a web application requests a shared DLL, the symbolic link points the application
to the shared location.

The advantage of interning your assemblies is that your assembly won’t be loaded
multiple times into memory. Instead, one copy will be loaded that gets used by all web
applications that reference it.

3. How you can you do this?

You can use assembly interning by using the command-line tool aspnet_intern.exe.
If you run the following command from a command line on your server, the aspnet_intern tool will analyze which assemblies are shared and move them to the specified location:
aspnet_intern -mode exec -sourcedir "C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Temporary ASP.NET Files" -interndir C:\CommonAssemblies

The aspnet_intern tool also has an analyze mode that shows you which assemblies it can intern for you. You can run the analyze command with a verbose flag like this:
aspnet_intern -mode analyze -sourcedir "C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Temporary ASP.NET Files" -v

You can intern your assemblies by running the aspnet_intern tool regularly on your server.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
145) You are building a strong-named assembly and you want to reference a regular assembly to reuse some code you built. What should you do?

A. You first need to put the assembly in the GAC.
B. Nothing. Referencing another assembly is always possible.
C. You need to sign the other assembly before using it.
D. You need to use the public key token of the other assembly to reference it.

C A strong-named assembly can reference only other assemblies that are also strongly named. 
This is to avoid security flaws where a depending assembly could be changed to influence the behavior of a strong-named assembly.

Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: An assembly in the GAC needs to be strongly named. Your assembly still
won’t be able to reference the unsigned assembly.
B. Incorrect: A strong-named assembly cannot reference a non-strong-named
assembly.
C. Correct: You need to strongly name the other assembly before you can reference
it.
D. Incorrect: The public key token is a part of the manifest of a strong-named
assembly. The non-strong-named assembly doesn’t have this key information. It
needs to be strongly named first.   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
146) You are building an assembly that will be used by a couple of server applications. You want to make the update process of this assembly as smooth as possible. 
Which steps should you take? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Run aspnet_intern.
B. Deploy the assembly to the GAC.
C. Add an assemblyBinding section to each client application that points to the location of the assembly.
D. Strongly name the assembly.

BD

Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: aspnet_intern is used to intern assemblies, meaning that only one copy
of an assembly will be loaded in memory when it’s referenced by multiple web
applications. This is only for performance reasons. It doesn’t mean you can update
the assembly in one location.
B. Correct: A shared assembly can be deployed in the GAC. Other applications can
reference it there. When you want to update it, you can do so by deploying the
new version to the GAC. By using configuration files, you can then let other applications
reference your new assembly.
C. Incorrect: You can use the assemblyBinding configuration element to add extra
search locations for an assembly. It asks for changes to each client application,
however. The GAC is the location in which a shared assembly needs to be
deployed.
D. Incorrect: Strongly naming an assembly doesn’t make it a shared assembly. Each
application still requires its own copy.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
147) You want to deploy an assembly to a shared location on the intranet. Which steps should you take? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Strongly name the assembly.
B. Use the codebase configuration element in the applications that use the assembly.
C. Deploy the assembly to the GAC.
D. Use the assemblyBinding configuration element with the probing option.

AB

The probing option can be used only to point to locations that are relative to the application path. 
If you want to locate assemblies  somewhere else, you have to use the codebase element.

Correct answers: A, B
A. Correct: Strongly naming the assembly is required to be able to reference it on
the intranet.
B. Correct: The codebase configuration element can be used to have local client applications
know they can find an assembly on another location such as the intranet.
C. Incorrect: Deploying it to the GAC doesn’t put the assembly on the intranet.
D. Incorrect: The probing option can be used only to give additional locations relative
to the application path. It can’t be used to point to the intranet.

148) You are developing a WCF service that compares several data sources. The service takes a long time to complete.
The service must meet the following requirements:
✑ The client must be able to continue processing while the service is running.
✑ The service must initiate communication with the client application when processing is complete.
You need to choose a message pattern to meet the requirements.
Which message pattern should you choose?

A. One Way
B. Streaming
C. Duplex
D. Request/Reply

C

A duplex service contract is a message exchange pattern in which both endpoints can send messages to the other independently. 
A duplex service, therefore, can send messages back to the client endpoint, providing event-like behavior. 
Duplex communication occurs when a client connects to a service and provides the service with a channel on 
which the service can send messages back to the client. Note that the event-like behavior of duplex services 
only works within a session.

149) You are developing a WCF service.
A new service instance must be created for each client session.
You need to choose an instancing mode.
Which instance mode should you use?

A. PerCall
B. Single
C. Multiple
D. PerSession
E. PerRequest

D
PerSession: A new InstanceContext (and therefore service object) is created for each new client session and maintained for the lifetime of that session (this requires a binding that supports sessions).

Incorrect: Answers -
A: PerCall: A new InstanceContext (and therefore service object) is created for each client request.
B: Single: A single InstanceContext (and therefore service object) handles all client requests for the lifetime of the application.
References:
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms731193(v=vs.110)
https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-wcf-services/0596526997/ch04s03.html

******Choosing an instancing mode******
The InstanceContextMode setting is another critical item that has a significant impact on the behavior of the service. 
This setting specifies the number of service instances available for handling calls to the service. 
There are three possible values for it, coupled with the three values of the ConcurrencyMode, giving you nine different possible combinations.

Single
A single instance of the WCF Service is used for all client requests. This has the benefit of not having to constantly create and destroy instances, 
but it should be obvious that this has the downside of be limiting in terms of large client request volumes:
[ServiceBehavior(InstanceContextMode=InstanceContextMode.Single)]
public class TestService : ITestService
{}

PerSession
This is the default setting (remember this!) and creates one or more instance per client:
[ServiceBehavior(InstanceContextMode=InstanceContextMode.PerSession)]
public class TestService : ITestService
{}

PerCall
This setting creates one instance (or more) for each client request:
[ServiceBehavior(InstanceContextMode=InstanceContextMode.PerCall)]
public class TestService : ITestService
{}

******Managing services concurrency******
People frequently confuse instancing and concurrency, so let’s get the distinction out of the way right now. As part of the
ServiceBehavior you can define a ConcurrencyMode. The ConcurrencyMode enumeration has three values: single, reentrant, and multiple.

Single
At any given time, only a single request has access to the WCF Service object. The big implication
here is that, if multiple requests hit the host at once, each subsequent one is blocked
until the one before it is processed:
[ServiceBehavior(ConcurrencyMode=ConcurrencyMode.Single)]
public class TestService : ITestService
{}

Multiple
At any given time, multiple requests can be processed by the WCF Service object. Subsequent requests are processed on separate threads. This can lead to a tremendously high number of threads being created. Although this will lead to significant throughput compared with a value of single, there are many other considerations you need to take into account to take full advantage of this setting:
[ServiceBehavior(ConcurrencyMode=ConcurrencyMode.Multiple)]
public class TestService : ITestService
{}

Reentrant
A single request is processed on one thread, but the thread can leave the service to call another service, and it can also communicate backward to a client through a callback without deadlocking:
[ServiceBehavior(ConcurrencyMode=ConcurrencyMode.Reentrant)]
public class TestService : ITestService
{}

155) You are developing a library to support multiple ASP.NET MVC web applications on a shared server. The library provides implementations of security algorithms.
If a problem with any of the security algorithms is discovered, a new version of the library must be created and deployed. Application downtime during the update must be minimized.
You need to ensure that the new version of the library will be used by all applications as soon as possible.
What should you do?

A. Build the web applications and include the security assembly as an embedded resource. When an update is needed, copy the new assembly to the bin directory for the application.
B. Sign all assemblies in each application with the same key used to sign the security assembly. When an update is needed, create a new key pair and re-sign all assemblies.
C. Build the security assembly as a netmodule in a shared location. Use the assembly linker to merge the netmodule into the assemblies for the application. When an update is needed, update the netmodule in the shared location.
D. Install the security assembly in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC). When an update is needed, update the assembly in the GAC.

You need to prevent the application from reading data that is locked by other transactions. You also need to prevent exclusive range locks.
Which isolation level should you use?

A. ReadCommitted
B. Serializable
C. Repeatable
D. ReadUncommitted

C  

Range locks are placed in the range of key values that match the search conditions of each statement executed in a transaction. 
This blocks other transactions from updating or inserting any rows that would qualify for any of the statements executed by the 
current transaction. This means that if any of the statements in a transaction are executed a second time, they will read the same 
set of rows. The range locks are held until the transaction completes. This is the most restrictive of the isolation levels because 
it locks entire ranges of keys and holds the locks until the transaction completes

164) You are developing a RESTful API that uses ASP.NET Core. You plan to host the API in Azure App Services. You provision a 
development environment in the application service. Developers must be able to deploy the API to the development environment. 
You must not share the Azure account credentials with developers. You need to ensure that developers can deploy the API to the 
development environment.

Solution: Download the Publish profile for the application service and share it with the developers. Use Microsoft Visual Studio Publishing.
Does the solution meet the goal?

A. Yes
B. No

A

Visual Studio does not offer you all the features that you can configure when creating a
package, but it’s one of the easiest ways to create a package.
You start the publish process by choosing Publish <YourProjectName> from the Build
menu. Figure 5-14 shows the start page of your wizard. The first time, you need to create a
publish profile. This profile is stored as a part of your solution. This way, you can add your
profile to source control and reuse it each time you publish your app. This is called one-click
publishing. Next time, you only need to click Publish, and a Web Deploy will be automatically
executed. You can create multiple profiles for different scenarios. Maybe you are running in
a DTAP (development, test, acceptance, production) environment and you want a publish
profile for each of these locations. By creating multiple profiles, you can easily store your
deployment settings. When deploying to Windows Azure Websites, you don’t have to create the publish profile
manually. When you log in to your Windows Azure Management Portal, you can download a
publish profile for your website. If you import this file into Visual Studio, your project is automatically
configured for deployment to your Windows Azure Websites.

To configure deployment for a web project in Visual Studio, you create one or more publish profiles using the Publish Web wizard. 
A publish profile specifies the server you are deploying to, the credentials needed to log on to the server, the databases to deploy, 
and other deployment options. When you are ready to publish, you choose the profile you want to use and click the Publish button in 
the wizard or in the Web One Click Publish toolbar.

Each code element may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.)
Select and Place: {nuspec, nupkg, pack, build }

1. Define the package in a ... file. 
2. Build the package with the following command. NuGet ... MyPackage...

=> 1. 	Define the package in a nuspec file. Which is obtained using nuget spec MyPackage.dll  
		This code creates a MyPackage.nuspec file for you that contains your manifest. A .nuspec file is an XML manifest that 
		contains package metadata. This is used both to build the package and to provide information to consumers. The manifest is always included in a package.
		You can now edit this file to make sure that things such as the title and description and the dependencies are correct. 

=> 2. 	Build the package with the following command. NuGet pack MyPackage.nuspec 
		After that, you can create your package: nuget pack MyAssembly.nuspec
		This code results in a MyAssembly.dll.1.0.0.nupkg package file. You can now test your package from Visual Studio by opening 
		a project and executing the following command from the Package Manager Console:
		install-package MyAssembly.dll -Source "C:\<location_of_your_package>"

186) You are developing a Microsoft Azure web application. The application will be deployed to 20 web role instances. 
A minimum of 18 running instances is needed to meet scaling requirements.
You need to configure the application so that upgrades are performed as quickly as possible, but do not violate scaling requirements.
How many upgrade domains should you use?

A. 1
B. 2
C. 5
D. 10

D

If you use 10 upgrade domains each upgrade domain will have two web role instances.
Because Windows Azure distributes instances of a role evenly (when possible) across a set number of upgrade domains. 
During deployment all instances of the upgraded role that belongs to the first upgrade domain are stopped, upgraded, and brought back online.
Once they are back online, the process is repeated for the second upgrade domain (all roles stopped, upgraded and brought back online), 
the third upgrade domain and so on until all instances in all upgrade domains have been upgraded. So in this case because
each upgrade domains has two web role instances, two web role instances are stopped each time.    

The number of upgrade domains can be configured as a part of the service definition file (.csdef). 
The default number of upgrade domains is 5, and the maximum is 20.  Windows Azure distributes instances 
of a role evenly (when possible) across a set number of upgrade domains. For example, if the default number 
of upgrade domains is used and a service has five instances, each instance will be assigned to an individual 
upgrade domain. In the case of a service having ten instances, each upgrade domain will have two instances. 
In the case of a service having 14 instances, the first four upgrade domains will have three instances, and the 
last one will have two instances.

Web Deploy is an extensible client-server tool for syncing content and configuration to IIS. Web Deploy is used primarily in two scenarios:
✑ Developers use it to sync (aka "˜publish') a compiled web applications (ASP .Net, PHP etc) from developer tools (Visual Studio, WebMatrix, etc) to IIS
✑ IT professionals use it to migrate websites & applications
Web Deploy is often compared to technologies like FTP, XCOPY or RoboCopy. While these technologies are useful, Web Deploy offers several benefits:
✑ Web Deploy can publish databases. Web Deploy has out-of-box support for scripting out SQL Server, MySQL Server, Sqlite and SQL Server Compact databases and applying the resulting script during the sync. This can be very handy if your app needs a database to function.
Incorrect Answers:
A: When you need to export a database for archiving or for moving to another platform, you can export the database schema and data to a BACPAC file.
D: DACPAC is a single file which contains database model i.e. all files represent database objects. It's a binary representation of database project compatible with
SSDT.

What is a DACPAC file?
Data package created by a Microsoft SQL Server data tier application; contains both the schema of data as well as the data 
records, or objects, themselves; used for providing data between SQL Server databases and vendor applications.
DACPAC files use .ZIP formatting and contain a collection of XML files that define the schema and data to be transferred.

https://www.sqlshack.com/an-introduction-to-data-tier-applications-in-sql-server/

BACPAC file 
A BACPAC file is a ZIP file with an extension of BACPAC containing the metadata and data from the database. 
A BACPAC file can be stored in Azure Blob storage or in local storage in an on-premises location and later 
imported back into Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, or a SQL Server instance.Jul 16, 2019

If you have multiple threads which are writing the data in database like this.
The SQLiteDatabaseLockedException is thrown.
//thread-1
DatabaseHelper helper = new DatabaseHelper(getApplicationContext());
SQLiteDatabase database = helper.getWritableDatabase();
database.insert(.....);
database.close();
 
//thread-2
DatabaseHelper helper = new DatabaseHelper(getApplicationContext());
SQLiteDatabase database = helper.getWritableDatabase();
database.insert(.....);
database.close();

A: The common relational library (shared by Entity Framework relational database providers) defines APIs for modelling concepts that are common to most relational database engines. A couple of these concepts are not supported by the SQLite provider: Schemas, Sequences, Computed columns.
The SQLite database engine does not support a number of schema operations that are supported by the majority of other relational databases. If you attempt to apply one of the unsupported operations to a SQLite database then a NotSupportedException will be thrown.
D: SQLite allows multiple processes to have the database file open at once, and for multiple processes to read the database at once. When any process wants to write, it must lock the entire database file for the duration of its update.

200) You are developing an ASP.NET Core web application by using an Entity Framework code-first approach. The application uses an Azure SQL Database. 
The code-first migration is configured to run as part of a continuous integration build.
You must add an Azure MySQL Database. This database must use the same schema as the existing Azure SQL Database instance.
You need to configure the migration to ensure that the existing TFS build definition remains unchanged.
What are two possible ways to achieve this goal? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.
Each correct selection is worth one point.

A. Use the ActiveProvider property to specify the provider to which the migration is applied.
B. Create a new type that derives from DbContext and override the ActiveProvider object. Then, add or apply migrations using this type.
C. Use the Entity Framework Core Fluent API to identify database providers.
D. Create a separate Migration Assembly than the one containing the DbContext and switch the active provider during build.  

AB

I thinks It’s A & B. D is wrong in this case because the TFS build definition remains unchanged. The answer specifies that the active provider would change during the build.

A: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/providers#one-migration-set
“If operations can only be applied on one provider (or they’re differently between providers), use the ActiveProvider property to tell which provider is active.”
B: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/providers#two-migration-sets
“Another approach that makes working with the tools easier is to create a new type that derives from your DbContext and overrides the active provider. This type is used at design time when adding or applying migrations.”

201) You have a web application that was developed by using Microsoft ASP.NET MVC. The application is deployed to an Azure web app and uses an Azure SQL
Database.
From a development environment, you use Microsoft Visual Studio to change the application code, and you modify the schema of the database.
You need to deploy the changes to Azure.
Which publishing method should you use?
A. BACPAC
B. FTP
C. Web Deploy
D. DACPAC

C

Web Deploy is an extensible client-server tool for syncing content and configuration to IIS. Web Deploy is used primarily in two scenarios:
✑ Developers use it to sync (aka "˜publish') a compiled web applications (ASP .Net, PHP etc) from developer tools (Visual Studio, WebMatrix, etc) to IIS
✑ IT professionals use it to migrate websites & applications
Web Deploy is often compared to technologies like FTP, XCOPY or RoboCopy. While these technologies are useful, Web Deploy offers several benefits:
✑ Web Deploy can publish databases. Web Deploy has out-of-box support for scripting out SQL Server, MySQL Server, Sqlite and SQL Server Compact databases and applying the resulting script during the sync. This can be very handy if your app needs a database to function.
Incorrect Answers:
A: When you need to export a database for archiving or for moving to another platform, you can export the database schema and data to a BACPAC file.
D: DACPAC is a single file which contains database model i.e. all files represent database objects. It's a binary representation of database project compatible with
SSDT.

202) You are preparing to develop a set of libraries for a company.
The libraries must be shared across the company.
You need to create a remote NuGet feed that exposes the libraries.

What should you do? (Each answer presents part of the solution. Choose all that apply.)

A. Install the NuGet.Feed Package.
B. Install the NuGet.Server Package.
C. Create a new Empty Web Site in Visual Studio.
D. Configure the Packages folder located in the appSettings section of the web application's Web.config.
E. Add packages to the Packages folder.
F. Create a new Empty Web Application in Visual Studio.

BDEF

B: NuGet.Server is a package provided by the .NET Foundation that creates an ASP.NET application that can host a package feed on any server that runs IIS.
The process is as follows:
✑ (F) Create an empty ASP.NET Web application in Visual Studio and add the NuGet.Server package to it.
✑ (E) Configure the Packages folder in the application and add packages.
✑ Deploy the application to a suitable server.
D: Configuring the Packages folder
With NuGet.Server 1.5 and later, you can more specifically configure the package folder using the appSetting/packagesPath value in web.config:
<appSettings>
<!-- Set the value here to specify your custom packages folder. -->
<add key="packagesPath" value="C:\MyPackages" />
</appSettings>

203) You develop an ASP.NET MVC application that is secured by using SSL. You are ready to deploy the application to production.
The deployment package must include the installation of the SSL certificate.
You need to configure the deployment package to meet the requirement.
What should you do?

A. Create a web publish pipeline target file with a custom web deploy target.
B. In the Package/Publish settings of the project, select the All Files in this project option.
C. Extend the CopyAllFilesToSingleFolder target in the project file.
D. In the Build Events settings of the project, configure a pre-build event to include the SSL certificate. 

A

Extending the Web Publishing Pipeline
The Web Publishing Pipeline (WPP) is the process that Visual Studio uses when you create a deployment package or use one-click publish.
Some aspects of the WPP can be extended by modifying the XML files that control MSBuild behavior. For example, tasks that that you can handle by modifying
XML files include the following:
* Installing SSL certificates on the destination server.
* Excluding specific Web application files or folders from the package.
* Precompiling the Web application before the package is created.
* Installing application assemblies in the GAC on the destination server.
* Updating registry keys on the destination server.

206) The solution will be highly available. You define regional Azure outages as periods of 60 seconds or more where the Event Service is not available.
You need to configure settings to identify regional outages. Which values should you use? To answer, drag the appropriate values to the correct settings. 
Each value may be used once, more than once, or mot at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.
Each correct selection is worth one point.

Values: 3, 5, 10, 20 

Probing interval: ??
Tolerated number of Failures: ??

Answer:

Probing interval: 10 (Fast probing)
Tolerated number of Failures: 5

Probing interval. This value specifies how often an endpoint is checked for its health from a Traffic Manager probing agent. 
You can specify two values here: 30 seconds (normal probing) and 10 seconds (fast probing). If no values are provided, the 
profile sets to a default value of 30 seconds. Visit the Traffic Manager Pricing page to learn more about fast probing pricing.

Tolerated number of failures. This value specifies how many failures a Traffic Manager probing agent tolerates before marking 
that endpoint as unhealthy. Its value can range between 0 and 9. A value of 0 means a single monitoring failure can cause that 
endpoint to be marked as unhealthy. If no value is specified, it uses the default value of 3.

207) The solution will use API Management to provide caching for the Event Service. You need to ensure that data is cached. 
How should you complete the markup? To answer, drag the appropriate XML segments to the correct locations. 

Choices: none | private | public | vary-by-header | vary-by-query-parameter | Accept | X-Customer

<policies>
    <inbound>
        <base />
        <cache-lookup 
			downstream-caching-type = "???">
            <???>???</???>
		</cache-lookup>
	</inbound>
</policies>

Answer:

<policies>
    <inbound>
        <base />
        <cache-lookup 
			downstream-caching-type = "public">
			<!-- should be present in most cases -->
            <vary-by-header>Accept</vary-by-header>
		</cache-lookup>
	</inbound>
</policies>

Use the cache-lookup policy to perform cache look up and return a valid cached response when available. 
This policy can be applied in cases where response content remains static over a period of time. Response caching 
reduces bandwidth and processing requirements imposed on the backend web server and lowers latency perceived by API consumers.

downstream-caching-type	This attribute must be set to one of the following values.
- none - downstream caching is not allowed.
- private - downstream private caching is allowed.
- public - private and shared downstream caching is allowed.

vary-by-header	Start caching responses per value of specified header, such as Accept, 
Accept-Charset, Accept-Encoding, Accept-Language, Authorization, Expect, From, Host, If-Match.
