Google Analytics Individual Qualification (IQ)

1) Auto-tagging is used to collect data from which kinds of traffic?

A. Website referral traffic
B. Search engine traffic other than Google
C. Social media traffic
D. AdWords Campaign traffic

Correct Answer: D

A feature that automatically adds a parameter to your URLs to help you track offline conversions and report on your ad performance using 
website tracking programs like Google Analytics.

The GCLID, or auto-tagging, is a default feature of Google Ads that allows marketers to better track their paid campaigns. 
When the feature is turned on, Google adds the GCLID parameter to your URL every time a user clicks on your ads.

Auto-tagging will attach the “Google Click Identifier” (GCLID) parameter to the URL your customers click, and that will help you tell which 
ad was clicked for each visit to your site. Google Analytics and similar programs can use the information from auto-tagged URLs to tell you 
which Google Ads keywords brought a visitor to your site, which campaign that keyword was from, and how much that click cost. You can also 
use this information to import complex conversions into Google Ads, whether online or offline.

For example, if someone clicks on your ad for www.example.com, the final URL look like www.example.com/?gclid=123xyz.

GCLID URL examples:
– www.business.com/?gclid-123
– www.business.com/parameter=1&glcid=123

Understanding the GCLID is an essential skill for any marketer, particularly those looking to get the most out of their pay-per-click marketing.

The GCLID tracks a wealth of information, including:

Traffic source (e.g: search engine result, website page etc)
Campaign
Ad group
Keyword, or keywords
Search Query
Time of day
Keyword positioning

This information is vital to understanding which ads and keywords are working, and which ones aren’t.

he GCLID only works for Google Ads traffic. That means that your organic social traffic, your organic search traffic, and even your Microsoft Ads traffic, 
is going untracked.

2) Which report indicates the last page users viewed before leaving your website?
A. All Pages report
B. Landing Pages report
C. Exit Pages report
D. Pages report

Correct Answer: C

The exit page is the last page a visitor views before they leave your website. In simple words, it shows how many people exit from a particular webpage.
You can see them as a percentage in Google Analytics and the metric is also knowns as exit rate.

Here’s what their journey looks like for a normal purchase: Homepage » Product Page » Checkout Page » Thank You Page
The exit rate for the thank you page will be calculated as the number of exits divided by the number of pageviews.

Now, having a high exit rate isn’t bad. In this situation, having a high number of exits from a thank you page is good since a customer purchased your 
product and left.

To view your Exit Page report, first log in to your Google Analytics account. Next, from the menu panel on your left, go to Behavior » Site Content » Exit Pages.

Just like bounce rate, it’s important to keep an eye on the number of exits on a particular page. That’s because it will help you understand your user’s behavior.
For instance, if they’re leaving from your checkout page and abandoning shopping carts, then you need to look at your checkout process and perhaps make it simpler.

For example, if your date range is January 1 to January 28:

1-Day Active Users: the number of unique users who initiated sessions on your site or app on January 28 (the last day of your date range).
7-Day Active Users: the number of unique users who initiated sessions on your site or app from January 22 through January 28 (the last 7 days of your date range).
14-Day Active Users: the number of unique users who initiated sessions on your site or app from January 15 through January 28 (the last 14 days of your date range).
28-Day Active Users: the number of unique users who initiated sessions on your site or app from January 1 through January 28 (the entire 28 days of your date range).

Smart Goals are configured at the view level. Smart Goals use machine learning to examine dozens of signals about your website sessions to 
determine which of those are most likely to result in conversions. Each session is assigned a score, with the "best" sessions being translated 
into Smart Goals. Some examples of the signals included in the Smart Goals model are Session duration, Pages per session, Location, Device and Browser. 
(Remarketing Smart Lists use a similar machine learning model to identify your best users.)

50) In views that don’t have data import enabled, Custom Dimensions values may be viewed for dates before the Custom Dimension was created.
A. True
B. False

Correct Answer: B

Custom dimension and metric are default dimensions that you create yourself so you can not see the custom dimension value before creating the custom dimension itself.
You need to understand that Custom dimensions and custom metrics are like default dimensions and metrics in your Analytics account, except you create them yourself. 
You can use them to collect and analyze data that Analytics doesn’t automatically track. And Data Import lets you upload data from external sources and combine it 
with data you collect via Analytics. So, there is no way to see the custom dimension value before creating the custom dimension.

A. Google Tag Manager 
B. Sign-in that generates and sets unique IDs 
C. A new Analytics account for reporting 
D. All of the above 

Correct Answer: B

The User ID enables the association of one or more sessions (and any activity within those sessions) with a unique and persistent ID that you send to Analytics. 
To implement the User ID, you must be able to generate your own unique IDs, consistently assign IDs to users, and include these IDs wherever you send data to Analytics. 
For example, you could send the unique IDs generated by your own authentication system to Analytics as values for the User ID. Any engagement, like link clicks and page 
or screen navigation, that happen while a unique ID is assigned can be sent and connected in Analytics via the User ID.
With user ID you can tag the user so you can see the behavior in all the sessions. To make it work you have to generate your own unique IDs and assign them to 
users when sending data to Analytics.

2) Another default medium is “referral.” Any traffic that comes to your site from another website that’s not a search engine will show up in your reports as a “referral.”
3) The final default medium is “(none).” This medium is applied only for users that come directly to your site by either typing your URL into a browser or clicking on a bookmark. 
   In your reports, you will see these users have a source of “direct” and a medium of “(none).”

A. Analytics will associate users and sessions with a single domain
B. Analytics will not associate users and sessions with any domain
C. or Analytics will send an alert about duplicate data collection
D. Analytics will associate users and sessions with their respective domains

Correct Answer: D

One of the first things you should know about when using and configuring Analytics is how the domain of the web property you are tracking is defined 
as a “site” for the purposes of viewing your reports. The default setup of the tracking code is designed to make it easy for you to track traffic to 
a single domain or subdomain (e.g. a single website URL) that does not share user data with other domains or sub-domains.

For example, if your pet store URL is dogs.example.com and you install the tracking code with its web property ID on those pages, tracking is automatically 
set up to track user data only for this single URL. In a similar way, if you own the primary domain, such as www.example.com, and you install tracking for 
all pages on this site, user and referral traffic is recorded separately for www.example.com.

By default, the channel labels that you see in Multi-Channel Funnels reports (Paid Search, Organic Search, Social Network, etc.) 
are defined as part of the MCF Channel Grouping. If you have specific analysis requirements, you may wish to create your own Custom Channel Grouping(s), 
each with its own set of labels. When you share a Custom Channel Grouping, only the configuration information is shared. Your data remains private. 
The following channel labels are defined as part of the MCF Channel Grouping and are the labels used by default in your reports. 
The channel definitions are not case sensitive.
