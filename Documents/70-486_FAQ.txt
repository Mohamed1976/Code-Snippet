1) You are a consultant helping a municipal government bring some of its services
onto the Internet. The first application you will work on enables pet licensing
over the web. The initial work was done by a volunteer from the local pet shelter.
Although it is an attractive website that was very well received by the public, it provides
only downloadable forms that must be filled out and returned manually.

Answer the following questions about your approach to enhancing this website:

A) The client received positive feedback on its current website design and wants to
keep it. How would you plan to maintain the look and feel across the new application?
What components need to be included in your architecture?

Answer:
To maintain the same look and feel across the website you need to use the same
style for your HTML pages and forms across the website. The best way to maintain a website'a style is to 
use CSS files. Furthermore you can use a _Layout page to give the user a familiar
navigation view when the user navigates through the website.             
Finally you can use partial views in order to reuse view content, so that simmilar
views have the same look and feel. Also the navigation structure of the website matters,
you need to make sure that the controllers and actions have easy/logical names.    

Book answer: 
By default, most of the HTML design that went into the original site would be put into
the views. Common areas such as navigation or boilerplate text could be put into a
layout page if there is a lot of reuse. Also, any areas that might need independent
functionality could be put into a partial view.

B)The department currently files submitted forms in alphabetical order by pet
owner. What could you do with the information so the employees would have
real-time access to it?

Answer:
You can scan and store the returned forms in a database, and provide access to them
via the website or via a standalone application. It would be much easier
to let the Pet owners fill in an online form on the website, the entered
data will be processed and put into a database and employees can directly
access the data via a separate custom made webpage.          

Book answer:
There are several ways that this could be done. The first is to simply put the form
online and email the form results to the department. This gives them minimal advantage
over their current process and is not in real time. The next is to use a data storage
mechanism such as SQL Server to store the information in a database. This enables
them to have reports built as needed as well as giving them real-time access into the
data.

C)You realize you would be best served by creating a separate business layer. How
would you manage this layer?

Answer:
The ASP Net Core framework provides a certain level of SoC by breaking the application
responsibilities down into models, views, and controllers. Many aspects of each
can be customized if necessary by overriding the base classes and creating your own.
Therefore you can create models that represent you business layer, and use those
models in your controllers to provide the the requested information to the views. 

Book answer:
A typical breakdown of models for this situation could be a model for the user, a
model for the pet, and a model for the license year. The user might have multiple
pets and each pet might have multiple licenses, one for each year. The models would
handle the access into and out of the database. This application is a candidate for using
the Repository pattern because the system used to manage the backend might be
replaced as more departments go online and the municipality might standardize in a
different direction.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) You are designing an application in which a section of the main page will be populated
by content from a third-party provider. You do not have control over the responsiveness
of the client or how much information will be returned with each request. The call
is to a RESTful service and will return the information formatted in Extensible Markup
Language (XML). What is the best way to implement this application?

A. Design a model that handles the data call to populate the model. Create a partial
view containing only this display area and put an asynchronous service call that
returns this model in the partial view controller.
B. Put a synchronous service call into the main page controller.
C. Create a partial view containing only this display area and put a synchronous service
call in the partial view controller.
D. Create a partial view containing only this display area and put an asynchronous
service call in the partial view controller.

Answer:
A. You have more control over the request to the third-party service. 
You create an asynchronous action method in the controller that returns a partial view.
The partial view is rendered in a separate thread. 
Alternatively you can use a view component instead of a partial view. 

Book answer: 
Correct answer: A
A. Correct: Because you do not have control over the responsiveness of the thirdparty
provider and you do not know how much data might be returned from each
call, you should wrap the call in the asynchronous framework. Providing the data in
a strongly-typed model gives it more flexibility than working with the raw XML on
the client side.
B. Incorrect: You do not know how long the call to the third party will take, and putting
a synchronous call into the main page will not give any response until the call
is completed.
C. Incorrect: You do not want to use a synchronous call in this case due to the unknown
response time.
D. Incorrect: Although you can take this approach, it infers that you will manipulate
the third-party response data in either the controller or the view. SoC recommends
that this manipulation occur in a model.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) You have been given requirements for a dashboard page that will contain summary information from your order processing system in a single display table. However, this summarization needs to be done by combining data requests from the order system, the shipping system, and the accounting system. The dashboard page will be the only place you use this combined data. What is the best way to implement this requirement?

A.Make the various data requests and compile the information in the controller for display.
B.Create an individual model for each of the data requests, and then create a view-specific model that calls those models and merges the data.
C.Create a model for the summary data and handle the various data requests within that model as well as the merging of the data.
D.Create an individual model for each of the data requests and then merge the data on the client side for display.

Answer:
A, Create a ViewModel that contains summary data that the view needs, in the controller 
make the various data requests to different services and put the information in the ViewModel 
that will then be passed to the view.

Book answer: 
Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: You should not perform any data manipulation in the controller.
B. Correct: You will have a better chance of code reuse if you break down the
separate calls into their own models and then create another model to pull them
together and compile them.
C. Incorrect: Although this would be a plausible way to implement the solution, it is
not the best. If any other work came up that uses any of the calls within this model,
you will either have to refactor the code to extract it at that point or have duplicate
code.
D. Incorrect: The fact that this data can be merged into a single table display shows
there is some intrinsic business worth to the information in this format. Merging on
the client side goes against SoC considerations.      
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) A significant change has been requested in an application maintained within your company. The application is a classic ASP application that uses custom Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) drivers to connect to a relational data repository on a mainframe computer. The CIO decided that the company needs to replace this 30-year-old system. The team that worked on the original project is made up of developers who have never worked with an object-oriented approach before. Which approaches would be the best to use when designing your initial schema in Entity Framework? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Create your own custom design because it’s too much work to manage an inexperienced staff.
B. Use Code First.
C. Use Model First.
D. Use Database First.

Answer:
D (Developers have experience with this database model, hence Entity Framework Models generated from the database are well understood by developers.)
B (The developers can model the database in a designer and generate the Entity Framework Models from the created design.)

Book answer:
Correct answers: C, D
A. Incorrect: You should incorporate your team into the project as soon as possible.
B. Incorrect: Because the team has no experience with object-oriented programming,
the Code First approach is unlikely to be the most efficient way to create the
new schema.
C. Correct: The use of the Entity Designer as an integral component in the Model
First approach will help unfamiliar users to walk through the process.
D. Correct: There is already a working relational database for the application,
although it is in a system that will be replaced. A port of the design should be
considered.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) You are designing an application that allows employees to change their human resources (HR) information, such as next of kin and direct deposit information. The requirements state that the application should talk directly to the HR systems’ database. However, at a recent company meeting, the CFO announced that the company will be converting to a new HR system over the next two years. They will take an additional year to move employees to the new system, one department at a time. How will this affect your design?

A. It won’t; the requirements state that the application should talk directly to the HR systems’ database.
B. You should ensure your naming convention for the database as clearly as possible so you can rework your data calls with minimal changes.
C. You should implement the Repository pattern with the current HR system being the first repository that is built. When the 
second system comes online, you implement that data access using the same pattern.
D. You should map the model directly to the database calls, anticipating that you will
have to change the model as the new system rolls out.

Answer:
C, The Repository pattern gives application designers the proper level of abstraction (a lot of flexibility).

Book answer:
Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: It is the designer’s job to ensure that any known enhancements or future
changes are accounted for. Although this approach follows the requirements,
it is not the best long-term solution.
B. Incorrect: This solution does not provide the proper level of abstraction; it requires
either a “one or the other” approach to supporting the HR system, or an
approach in which you have to manage which database you are calling from within
each data call.
C. Correct: Using the Repository pattern will give you a level of abstraction into the
data layer. When you create the second data access component for the new HR
system, you can then differentiate on a user or departmental level which implementation
to use.
D. Incorrect: This solution does not provide the proper level of abstraction; it requires
either a “one or the other approach” to supporting the HR system, or an
approach in which you have to manage which database you are calling from within
each data call.

6) You are the new technical architect at a large custom home building firm with offices
in North America, South America, and Europe. Your firm is expanding, both by
opening new offices and by buying smaller custom home builders. Although each
main geographic region stores its own data in its own systems, your CIO wants you
to build an application that displays information from each region in different widgets
on a dashboard. She does not want SQL queries run from the corporate office
where the dashboard will be hosted.

A. You will have to deploy some software in the various regions. What will the
software do? 
 
You can deploy WCF/WEB Api software to the various regions, the software will   
run SQL queries on the local databases and create Dashboard information that is needed by the main office.
When WCF/WEB Api is called by the main office application, it returns information that can then be displayed      
in the dashboard.  

Book answer:
Yes, because you cannot query the databases directly, you need to deploy some kind
of solution that gives you access to the data. This could be a web services wrapper to
enable you to call the data remotely or an application that will manage aggregating
the data.
 
B. What are some primary concerns of building an ASP.NET MVC application that
gathers information from such disparate sources? 

Some primary concerns are: connection latency (delay, Latency is how long it takes data to travel between its source and destination, measured in milliseconds. ),  
Connection resiliency becomes a point of concern when building a distributed application (connection loss and retry, you need to manage the concept of a retry.). 
Authorization and access are also complicated because you need to manage access into multiple domains. 

Book answer:
The primary concerns would be the inability to guarantee responsiveness and the need
to manage connection issues.
 
C. What is the benefit of adding Windows Azure AppFabric?

A distributed environment can improve availability, reliability, and scalability.
It allows for better scalability of the application servers.
Because application servers and data are distributed and redundantly stored
there is no single point of failure.   

Book answer:
AppFabric acts as a service bus, so it provides a single point of contact/service connector
that would manage the calls out to the remote systems by routing the requests to
the appropriate server.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7)You are developing an application. One requirement is that part of your data access
layer needs to be available to a third party, that wants to get this information from a
REST URL in XML. Your company does not have experience with web services, but you
have several websites running ASP.NET MVC 4. How could you design and provide
these new services? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Task an individual on staff to learn WCF, and have this individual develop and deploy
these new services using WCF.
B. Use the Web API to create REST services using ApiController in which the serialization
type is defined by the Accepts property of the browser.
C. Build a basic ASP.NET MVC 4 project in which the view simply passes through the
information provided by the controller, and the controller manages the code for
serializing the response.
D. Create an ASP.NET ASMX services file to get, serialize, and return the data.

answer: 
B) 	The ASP.NET Web API comes with its own controller called ApiController.
	By decorating a controller with the [ApiController] attribute in Asp Net Core, 
	it can directly return requested information.    
A) 	You can also use WCF (SOAP protocol) service to make the data available

book answer:
Correct answers: B, C

A. Incorrect: Although you would eventually be able to get a WCF REST services, it would not be efficient.
B. Correct: Using the Web API is a straightforward way to present REST services.
C. Correct: Using ASP.NET MVC is another way to create a controller that will return XML.
D. Incorrect: An ASMX web service is SOAP-based, not REST-based.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8)How could you traditionally consume an ASMX web service from your application?
(Choose all that apply.)

A. Generate a proxy by selecting Add Reference In Visual Studio.
B. Create an HttpService and connect using Get(URL).
C. Generate a proxy by selecting Add A Service Reference in Visual Studio.
D. Create a WCF proxy class.

Answer: 
B	Create an HttpService and connect using Get(URL), you can also use WebClient  
C	Add connected service in dependecies lets you create client-side code easily using direct Service .asmx URI (If available) 
	or using the WSDL file (If shared by the vendor or third party).


book answer:
Correct answers: B, C
A. Incorrect: Selecting Add Reference does not enable you to create a proxy.
B. Correct: HttpService.Get gets the output of a REST service.
C. Correct: Visual Studio creates a proxy for you from the WSDL at the site you select.
D. Incorrect: A WCF proxy class needs endpoints and bindings. REST services do not
use, nor understand, WCF endpoints and bindings.

9)What are examples of hybrid applications using Windows Azure? (Choose all that apply.)

A. An application where the local network hosts the IIS server while the database is
being run from the corporate IT office
B. An application where Windows Azure is used to host the IIS process, and Windows
Azure SQL is used to store the data
C. An application where the IIS process is run on a local web server, whereas the data
is stored in Windows Azure SQL
D. An application where the web part of the application is run on Windows Azure,
whereas the confidential data is stored in the company’s network

Answer:
C, D
A hybrid application is an application that is partially deployed on-premise and partly off-premise.
Answer: C, D in these cases the application is distributed over multiple premises.

book answer
Correct answers: C, D
A. Incorrect: Both the web application and the database storage are being run from
within the company network. Although this is a distributed design, it is not a hybrid
application.
B. Incorrect: Both the web instance and the data repository are using Windows
Azure technology. This is not a hybrid app; it is a fully deployed Windows Azure
application.
C. Correct: Part of the application is being run in the Windows Azure environment;
the other part is being run in the corporate network environment.
D. Correct: Part of the application is being run in the Windows Azure environment;
the other part is being run in the corporate network environment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10) Your company wants to refactor its mission critical line-of-business (LOB) application
to make it more robust and scalable as well as to increase performance.
The CIO wants to investigate hosting the item in Windows Azure. Currently, the
application has a lot of maintenance processes running in the background, such as
processes to ensure that there is no orphaned data by running queries against the
database, processes that check website availability with an email sent if a website
is non-responsive; and a process that counts how many users logged in during the
previous hour and sends an email to the IT support staff.
 
A. Where in the Windows Azure process would it make the most sense to put the
orphaned data check? 

You can override the Run method of the RoleEntryPoint to run code for
the life of the role instance. Because the Run method is void, your override of the Run method
can run in parallel with the default Run method if desired. You might want to do this if you
want to have background tasks running throughout the life of your application, such as 
continuously running queries against the database to ensure that there is no orphaned data.  

public class WorkerRole : RoleEntryPoint
{
	public override Run()
	{
		try
		{
			Trace.WriteLine("WorkerRole entrypoint called", "Information");
			while (true)
			{
				Thread.Sleep(250);
				CheckForOrphanedData();			
			}
			catch (Exception e)
			{
				Trace.WriteLine("Exception during Run: " + e.ToString());
			}
		}
	}
} 

Book answer
When you need something to run the lifetime of the application, putting it into the
override of the Run method is the best solution. It enables you to create a timer that
fires an event every x minutes that you want to run the check.

B. Would it make more sense to put these processes in a Worker role or within the Web role? 

These processes should be put in a web role.  
Web Sites is a good choice for simple web hosting, and is a good solution for hosting and
running your ASP.NET MVC 4 applications without the overhead of maintaining a full virtual
machine. Web Sites enables a scalable experience, with fast deployment and an almost immediate
startup, and you can upgrade or downgrade this solution quickly and easily as needed.

Book answer
They both would work. The advantage to putting them in a worker process is that they
can continue to function if the Web role has stopped for some reason. This is particularly
useful if there are other non-web ways of getting information into the database,
and you are still at risk for orphaned data.

C. Assuming that these processes were all C# console programs, do you think it
would be difficult to migrate them for use in the cloud? Why or why not?

I think it is doable/feasible, you need to check if the resulting website does not have any latency. 

Book answer
ovided that the processes are console applications, it should be relatively straightforward
to move them into methods that can be called from within startup process.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
11) What occurs if an unhandled error is fired on a startup task?

A. The startup role consumes the error during its load; if there is no event handler configured, it is set to Handled as the task completes.
B. The startup is cancelled and the role does not start.
C. The OnStop method automatically runs.
D. The startup task goes to the lowest security setting and continues to run, if possible.

Answer B  

Book answer
Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: If the startup task fires an unhandled error, the role startup stops in a
failure. The task will not complete successfully.
B. Correct: The task will stop processing and return a non-zero value.
C. Incorrect: The task will stop in error. The OnStop process will not run because the
role will not get that far.
D. Incorrect: The task will stop processing. It will not try to continue to run on a
lower security setting.

Answer 
A, C and D

Book Answer
Correct answers: A, C, D
A. Correct: AppCmd.exe enables the configuration of virtual sites.
B. Incorrect: There is no capability to manage users in AppCmd.exe.
C. Correct: AppCmd.exe supports the administration of general configuration sections.
D. Correct: AppCmd.exe manages the support of applications.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
13) Which of the following are valid reasons for overriding the Run method? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Creating and starting a messaging service that will work in parallel with the Web role to manage queued messages
B. Creating an always-running service that periodically makes HTTP calls to other websites to determine their availability
C. Managing error handling for the application
D. Starting and supporting a logging application for use by the Worker role

Answer
A, D

Book answer
Correct answers: A, B, D
A. Correct: Creating and running an application in parallel is what the Run method
was designed to allow.
B. Correct: The polling service is a good example of an activity in which the Run
method enables a process to work independently of the main role.
C. Incorrect: The error handling will be managed in the OnError event and will not
involve the overridden Run method.
D. Correct: Creating and running an application in parallel is what the Run method
was designed to allow.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14) You are an architect for a Fortune 1000 company that wants to create an internal
task and process management system. The concept of the system is to give visibility
to daily tasks that are performed throughout the company. Every employee is expected
to use the system and be diligent about inputting tasks and to manage the
statuses of the tasks as they move through the process. Your team was instructed
to design an architecture that would support hundreds of simultaneous users. You
have been given five physical servers and an old load balancer to run the system.
You also have several licenses for SQL Server.

A. How would you provision these servers for maximum reliability, safety, and performance?

You can implement a web farm architecture, this means that the five physical servers
will each host an IIS Webserver that runs the ASP Net Core Website. The loadbalancer
will direct incoming requests to the Webserver with the least workload.
Furthermore, data such as tasks and statuses need to be persisted in the SQL database.
These SQL database (lets assume three SQL database) can be installed on the webservers.
Alternatively, we could install the SQL databases separately on two of the five physical servers and 
install three webservers on the other three physical servers. It is important that the
SQL databases mirror/cluster their data, so in case that one of the SQL databases 
goes down, the other SQL databases have the same data.

Book answer
There are many different ways that you could provision the servers. A typical approach
would be to use two servers for SQL Server, with the data replicated between the
servers. One of the servers would be the primary SQL server while the other would be
the secondary, redundant fallback SQL server. Two other machines could be set up as
a web farm to handle the web requests. A fifth server could be added to the web farm,
or kept in reserve in case of a failure in either of the server blocks.

B. How would you manage the state in this situation?

Because we have a web farm architecture, the state of each request should be managed
central in the SQL server (outproc session).   

Book answer
There does not appear to be any real special cases for state management, so an Out-
Proc solution in which IIS is configured to use SQL Server to manage sessions should
be acceptable. This would enable the application to send requests to any server in the
farm without a loss of state data. Typically, it is best to use the IIS built-in state management
systems where available because it frees your team from having to write code
that might be redundant.

C. If two servers shut down at the same time because of hardware issues, and the
problem took several days to resolve, how would your application be affected?

The web farm be able to handle less requests, it could als be that the latency increases when an 
incoming request is handled because of the increased workload of the webservers.

Book answer
It depends on the two servers that were lost. Using at least two servers for the data tier
and the web tier should give you some contingency for hardware failures because it is
rare that more than one server goes out at a time. However, if two servers are lost at
the same time, the only real risk would be some downtime as you roll the fifth server
in to replace one of the ones that was lost. The only real data loss might be if both
servers in the database tier were lost, in which case it is likely that there will be some
data loss. If you lose one in each tier, or even both web servers in the farm, you can
provision the fifth server as a web server without any loss of data other than in those
requests that the server was processing as it went down.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15)You are designing an ASP.NET MVC 4 application that uses an Oracle database for persistence. What session configuration 
choices enable you to deploy your application on a web farm? (Choose all that apply.)

A. InProc
B. SQLServer
C. StateServer
D. Custom session provider

B, C and D  Outproc which means a central storage of the session information so that each webserver in the web farm has 
access to all the avaiable session information.

If your ASP.NET MVC application runs on an Oracle database, there is no built-in support for managing state that is shared by multiple servers. 
If you want to store the session information in a table in your Oracle database, you need to write a Custom session provider.

Book answer
Correct answers: C, D
A. Incorrect: InProc does not support web farms as session items are stored only in
the individual server’s memory.
B. Incorrect: SQLServer is not available in the application stack. This means that using
the default SQLServer state is not possible.
C. Correct: Using a shared state server across the web farm is an available option.
Using a state server designates one server to maintain state for all the servers that
connect to it.
D. Correct: A custom session provider enables you to maintain state as necessary by
doing the work in your custom code. It is generally used when you try to use a different
RDBMS system or when you do not want to use the default session database
design.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16) You are creating an ASP.NET MVC 4 web application that will be accessed by a large number of traditional consumers. 
If you need to be able to access state information on the client side in JavaScript/jQuery, where can you store it? (Choose all that apply.)

A. localStorage
B. QueryString
C. ViewState
D. Cookies

A, B and D (Not sure of JavaScript/jQuery is able to read the Cookies on the client side, cookies could be for example encrypted.)

Book answer
Correct answers: B, D
A. Incorrect: localStorage is HTML5 and is not available in all browsers.
B. Correct: Query string information is available across all browsers and is usable on
both the client and server.
C. Incorrect: Although ViewState is available in a form field on the page, it is encrypted
and cannot be used on the client side. It is also not used by many ASP.NET
MVC 4 constructs.
D. Correct: Cookies can be stored for a period of time on the client and be read from
either client- or server-side operations.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17) As you design a sessionless state management system, what do you need to ensure that your application manages? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Access to the state management system, whether it is a database, a web service, or other type of system
B. The HTTP headers
C. The session setting within the Web.config file
D. An identifier used by the server to identify the request

D

Book answer
Correct answers: A, D
A. Correct: Your application needs to manage whatever information might be required
to access the state management system.
B. Incorrect: The HTTP headers are usually not used as part of state management.
C. Incorrect: Because your application is sessionless, there is no need to manage session
in the Web.config file.
D. Correct: Your application needs to manage the passing of the identifier between
requests.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18)You are working at a company that has a custom inventory management system
that has been used for years. Company personnel recently completed an overhaul
of the web-based application that provides access into the system. Although they
are comfortable with the look, feel, and usability of the application, they are unhappy
with the performance, even after updating all their users to the most recent
hardware equipment and software. They find that every interaction with the server
is taking seconds. At times, this renders the application almost unusable. When you
look into the application, you see that all the models in the MVC structure do calls
into the database whenever they need data, even down to the level of the user’s
name, shift, and building, which are calls into different tables and displayed on
every page the user visits.

A. As you look into the system more carefully, you see 15 calls into the database for
every time a page is rendered that is strictly to provide basically static information
to the page. How could you use caching to improve this?

Data caching is an important form of caching that can decrease the load on your database and increase application responsiveness.
Static queries, in which the data is unlikely to change often, are excellent candidates for implementing data caching.
Introducing a caching layer on top of the persistence layer, can improve performance if your application requeries the same data.
If the same Data is accessed multiple time within a small timeframe (5 minutes),
you can cache the data in memory that is requested. If the data requested is
static for a long time (such as user’s name, shift, and building data), you can
cach data in memory for a longer time (One day, week), set expiration period for longer time.      

Book answer
There are several ways that caching could help this process. The first is to get the information
from the database and store it in localStorage. That way you never need to call
the server again unless the client realizes it does not have the information any more.
You could also use donut caching or donut hole caching, whichever is more appropriate,
to cache that area of the page where the information doesn’t change. If you assign
a duration of 30 minutes, you decrease a lot of redundant database calls.

B. After you have eliminated the redundant calls, you see that the application
makes calls into the database for every request to get supporting information
such as colors, product sizes, and box sizes. The application gets the complete
list from the database every time and then gets the necessary size, color, and so
on from that longer listing. How could caching be used to help this process?

You can cache the supporting information Query result, the cached supporting information can 
then be queried to retrieve the necessary size, color, and so on from the cached information.

Book answer
Because the list of colors, sizes, and so on is the same for all users, you could store this
information in a data cache layer in which the system will make only one call into the
database every x minutes and will make that same set of returned information available
to all users of the system. This gives you an immediate performance gain across all
users.

19) You are designing a work order management application for a mid-size repair company. The application will be used by repair personnel in the field on their laptops with wireless phone connections. The connections are slow, and the laptops are several years out of date. There will never be more than 15 users at any one time, and rarely more than 2 concurrent users. What kind of caching will give the repair personnel a better user experience? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Page output caching
B. Application caching
C. Data caching
D. HTTP caching

B (If you store assets (such as css, js , pics) on the client, Application caching can lower the amount of data that you need to download each time.)
D Using HTTP caching the server can detect whether any changes need to be returned, to the client.

Book answer
Correct answers: A, D

A. Correct: Page output caching will cache content at the client side to eliminate
some of the required downloads. It is useful in a limited bandwidth environment. It
can also be used in donut hole and donut caching scenarios for partial client-side
caching.
B. Incorrect: Application caching is an HTML5 feature, and it is unlikely that the older
laptops will be able to support the feature.
C. Incorrect: Data caching might decrease some server time, but with the limited
number of users, it is unlikely that the data access would be an issue.
D. Correct: HTTP caching will help response time even though there is not much a
developer needs to do to implement the caching.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20) You are creating a solution in which the majority of the application is dynamic, but some areas can be cached for a long time. What kind of approach would you take? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Data caching
B. Donut hole caching
C. Donut caching
D. Windows AppFabric caching

B, C The static parts of the view can be cached (by using a PartialView or View Component).

Book answer
Correct answers: B, C
A. Incorrect: Although data caching can add some support in a highly dynamic situation,
it does not support the capability to have long-term caching.
B. Correct: Donut hole caching provides the ability to cache parts of each page.
C. Correct: Donut caching is another approach that gives the ability to cache parts of
the application.
D. Incorrect: AppFabric caching would provide some support in a highly dynamic
situation, but it does not suit the need to store some of the page output.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21) You are adding a reporting vertical to an enterprise application. Many of the reports will be run every morning by a set of users. Some of the reports will be identical as every member of a team will get the same report sometime in the morning. What kind of caching will provide an improvement in performance? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Data caching
B. Page output caching with a duration of two minutes
C. Page output caching with a duration of four hours
D. Windows AppFabric caching

C, A (If the same data is requested from the database multiple times.)

Book answer
Correct answers: A, C, D
A. Correct: Data caching with the appropriate timeout will enable the data needed
for the reports to be stored so that the call to the database is not necessary.
B. Incorrect: Although a page output caching would be useful, the short time
frame of two minutes means that the cache will likely expire before the next user
requests the page.
C. Correct: A page output caching of four hours caches the output of the report
for the whole morning and should eliminate the need for the report to be run a
second time.
D. Correct: AppFabric caching acts much like data caching to eliminate the need for
additional calls to the database to generate the reports.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22)You are a consultant hired by an insurance and financial services firm, to create an
online system for employees to get breaking financial news as well as to communicate
with each other. The company already has a news tracking system that stores
relevant news articles and sends an email with the content of the articles to some
of the fund managers. The company wants to include this information as well as an
instant messenger application and create a simple site for communications for all
employees.

A. Although HTML5 WebSockets appears to be a natural fit to fulfill these requirements,
what kind of issues could you run into?

Although these days most browsers support HTML5 Websockets, it could be that some dont.
Furthermore, firewalls could block Websockets data traffic because the traffic does
not contain HTTP header information.       

Book answer
The most common set of issues you would encounter when creating a solution that
includes WebSockets is the nonuniversal support for HTML5. It is possible aspects of
the company’s business still run on non-HTML5-compliant browsers. Other issues you
could encounter include proxy servers, firewall filters, and other security systems that
might look at nontraditional HTML communications as a threat.

B. There appear to be two different communications processes going on. Would
you use a different socket connection for each one or share the same connection?
Explain your answer.

There are two different communications processes going on.
1) Financial news provider.
2) Messenger application so that employees can communicate with each other.

I would use two different socket connection because the functionality of the
two services is different, therefore they need to be handled differently on the
server.    

Book answer
When following a traditional SoC route, the design should manage each different type
of communication separately, even though it might be on the same page. This would
give them the opportunity to change independently of each other, perhaps by moving
to a different server or even starting to take the news feed from a third-party service
directly.

C. What kind of server-side services do you have to create?

A service that sends news information to the clients. 
A Messenger service that allows different employees to communicate with each other.  

Book answer
You need to create the server-side application that will be notified of news articles
and send the information to the users. You also need to create a server-side application
that will manage the instant messaging part of the application. Theoretically they
could be the same application, but it would be prudent to design them in such a way
that they could scale separately and independently.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
23) What is the technique in which the client sends a request to the server, and the server holds the response until it either times out or has information to send to the client is?

A. HTTP polling
B. HTTP long polling
C. WebSockets
D. HTTP request-response

B You send a request and wait until you receive an answer or timeout.

Book answer
Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: In HTTP polling, the client sends a request to the server, and as soon as
the response is returned, it sends a new request.
B. Correct: In HTTP long polling, the client sends a request to the server, and the
server holds it open until it either has something to return to the client or the connection
times out.
C. Incorrect: WebSockets are a way for two-way communication between the client
and the server. The server does not hold onto the response.
D. Incorrect: The request-response path is a traditional HTTP connection.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
24) You are building an application in which you want to display updated information to a website every 15 minutes. What are efficient ways to manage the update? (Choose all that apply.)

A. WebSockets
B. HTTP polling with 1-minute intervals
C. HTTP long polling
D. HTTP polling with 15-minute intervals 

A, D (When polling goes out of sync, in worse case you would get information that is 15 minutes old.) 

Book answer
Correct answers: A, D
A. Correct: WebSockets can be used to pass information between the client and
server.
B. Incorrect: HTTP polling can provide the need, but the 1-minute refresh interval
would not be efficient.
C. Incorrect: HTTP long polling is not a valid strategy. The typical timeout on a
single request is less than 15 minutes, and chaining multiple requests to get the
15-minute timespan is resource intensive.
D. Correct: HTTP polling with 15-minute intervals is a valid way to get the information
within the required time frame.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
25)What is the first request sent to start HTTP polling?

A. HTTP DELETE
B. HTTP GET
C. HTTP CONNECT
D. Upgrade request 

In client-server protocols, like HTTP, sessions consist of three phases:

-The client establishes a TCP connection (or the appropriate connection if the transport layer is not TCP).
-The client sends its request, and waits for the answer.
-The server processes the request, sending back its answer, providing a status code and appropriate data.

As of HTTP/1.1, the connection is no longer closed after completing the third phase, and the client is now granted a further request: this means the second and third phases can now be performed any number of times.

The TCP layer sets up a connection not the HTTP layer.

B HTTP GET is the first request sent to start HTTP polling. 

Book answer
Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: HTTP DELETE is not used to start the WebSocket connection; it is instead
used to perform a delete on a discrete item.
B. Correct: The first request to open a WebSocket connection is a standard HTTP
GET. After the request is received, the browser sends a separate upgrade request.
C. Incorrect: HTTP CONNECT converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/
IP tunnel.
D. Incorrect: The upgrade request is sent after the server has responded to an HTTP
GET request.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
26) You have been asked to create a set of web services. They will not be standard web
services; they will be based entirely on HTTP modules and HTTP handlers. These
services will be REST-based and need to support authentication.

A. What would be the most standard way to use HTTP modules and HTTP handlers
to fill this need?

An HTTP handler is used to process individual endpoint requests. Handler enables ASP.NET to process HTTP URLs within an application.
Each specific REST url can be handled by a specific HttpHandler.    
Authentication of REST-based webservices should be done in HttpModules.   

Creating an HTTP handler is a relatively simple way to create a customized process
to return XML or JSON return objects. Using it in a RESTful scenario is more complicated
because there is no extension to also map the handler. You have to manage all
requests without an extension and then filter the URL request to see what the appropriate
response would be.

B. If you needed to add custom authentication, where would be the best place to
put that functionality?

In a HTTP module you can subscribe to the AuthenticateRequest event.   
By registering an event handler for the AuthenticateRequest event, you can add override code
that will handle your custom authentication. 

The AuthenticateRequest and AuthorizeRequest events are the traditional access points
for authorization and authentication. You add the event handlers in the Init method
and you have access to the entire HTTP Request in the module as it moves through the
application stack.

C. Do you think that creating web services in handlers and modules would result in
a responsive application, or do you think performance would suffer? Why?

In order to have a a responsive application you need to perform asynchronous processing in the modules and handlers.

It would be a relatively responsive application, especially when comparing it to traditional
ASP.NET MVC applications. Because it would use its own custom handler, a lot of
the overhead of MVC would be left out of the process.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
27) In an HTTP module, can you redirect the request to a different handler than is in the routing table? If so, what event would you handle?

A. Yes, and you handle the PostAuthorizeRequest event.
B. No, after the request starts into the process, it either continues through to the mapped handler or throws an error.
C. Yes, and you handle the MapRequestHandler event.
D. Yes, and you handle the ReleaseRequestState event.

C, You can override the selection of the HttpHandler and redirect the request to a different handler than is in the routing table. 

Book answer
Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: The PostAuthorizeRequest event is thrown before the handler is
mapped.
B. Incorrect: You can handle the mapping of the request in the MapRequestHandler.
C. Correct: You handle the mapping of the request in the MapRequestHandler.
D. Incorrect: The ReleaseRequestState is thrown after the handler has completed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
28) When you are creating a custom handler, what is the parameter being passed into the ProcessRequest method?

A. object, EventArgs
B. HttpApplication
C. HttpContext
D. Object

C used in custom handler ProcessRequest(HttpContext context) 

Book answer
Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: object, EventArgs are the parameters used for the event handlers
thrown during the startup process. The event handlers are assigned in the Init
method.
B. Incorrect: HttpApplication is the parameter used in the Init method.
C. Correct: The ProcessRequest method takes the HttpContext parameter.
D. Incorrect: There are no default methods that just accept an object parameter.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
29) What is the best way to intercept every request for an image on your site and ensure that a watermark is added to the image?

A. An HTTP module handling the AuthorizeRequest event
B. A custom HTTP handler set to handle .htm and .html pages
C. A custom HTTP handler configured to serve .png and .jpg files
D. An HTTP module handling the PostRequestHandlerExecute event

C After every request check if Image is requested and if so add watermark.    

Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: A module is not the best way to handle the request because it would
have to deal with every HTTP request rather than just the image calls.
B. Incorrect: Serving .htm and .html pages will not create watermarks on image files.
C. Correct: Intercepting every request for .jpg and .png files is the easiest way to
consistently add watermarks to the images.
D. Incorrect: A module is not the best way to handle the request because it would
have to deal with every HTTP request rather than just the image calls.

30) Your company wants to update its website, which was built using ASP.NET MVC. The website is a portal for independent musicians to upload their recordings. Both registered and unregistered visitors can listen to music and provide feedback and comments. The main layout was done using tables to position elements within the page. Answer the following questions for your manager:

A. How can a webpage be rendered with dynamic content depending on the type of user?

If a user is authenticated, the webserver can use this information to render dynamic content.
For example you can return two different views from an action method in a controller.       

if(User.Authenticated)
{
	return View("SingersView");
}
else
{
	return View("GuestView");
}

Book answer
The decision to use dynamic content can add functionality to the view to check for
user information. The application decides what to display based on user information,
which is what makes the content dynamic.

B. Some of your potential visitors do not have browsers that support HTML5. How will that affect your design choice?

The design needs to take into account that pages containing HTML5 syntax must have fallback code to standard HTML syntax in case
the client browser does not support HTML5 syntax.          

Book answer
Because HTML5 is not yet supported by all browsers, some elements might not be able
to use certain styles, resulting in an experience different from what you expect. If you
use HTML5-specific tags in your application, such as <audio> or <video>, you should
have a fallback for displaying and managing the information.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
31)Layout.cshtml and Site.Master are the two default template pages in ASP.NET MVC. Which of the following scenarios would best be solved using a single layout or master template? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Your application has a requirement to display a menu section that changes based on the area of the application the user is visiting.
B. Each content area on your page needs a header that displays the company’s branded color and contains the first 40 characters of the content area’s content followed by an ellipsis.
C. You have created a set of styles, each in a different style sheet. The styles need to be available to every page in the application.
D. Your application has three different default page designs: two rows of information, two columns of information, and three columns of information.

A,C

Correct answers: A, C
A. Correct: Adding logic to the master page to determine the menu design enables
your application to display a menu section that changes based on the area of the
application the user is visiting.
B. Incorrect: The master page does not have the capability to “look” into the content
sections and select the first 40 characters.
C. Correct: Referencing all style pages in a single place, the layout page, is an
appropriate use.
D. Incorrect: A master page does not control the design of the content being
displayed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
32)You are designing a web application. You want to create a certain look and feel while
reusing styles across pages as much as possible. How should you handle styles?

A. Use only one or two styles throughout your application to simplify maintenance.
B. Use a specific (unique) style for every element.
C. Use general styles for common elements and specific styles for elements that are
unique.
D. Use inline styling.

A

Book answer
Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: It is unlikely that one or two styles will enable you to create the look
and feel you want.
B. Incorrect: Using a specific style for each element will limit your ability for style
reuse.
C. Correct: You should use general styles as much as possible. Achieving a certain
look and feel means that you might have to create some specific styles, however.
D. Incorrect: Although inline styling will give you the most, control over styling,
it removes the possibility of code reuse. Design changes would be difficult to
implement.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
33)What are compelling reasons to switch from static web content to dynamic web content?
(Choose all that apply.)

A. The ability to substitute a new image for the company logo
B. The ability to display information from a database
C. The ability to link to other pages outside of your application
D. The ability to display information pertaining to the current user

B, D

Book answer
Correct answers: B, D
A. Incorrect: There is no need to create a dynamic website simply to replace the
company logo.
B. Correct: Displaying data from a database is an ideal reason to use a dynamic
website.
C. Incorrect: Linking to other pages outside of an application does not require a
dynamic website.
D. Correct: Personalization, or displaying information about the user on-screen, is an
example of dynamic content.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
34) You want to update an ASP.NET MVC web application, and you decided to use
jQuery to make the website feel more fluid and easier to develop. The application
has various fields, including a memo field, an email field, and a date field. The application
also uses a set of buttons that makes up the navigation pane. When navigating,
the client must requery the server each time, which makes the application feel
less responsive.

Answer the following questions for your manager:
A. How can you prevent users from entering incorrect dates in a date-only field?

Using features such as a date picker, shown in the following code, can restrict user entry to
only valid dates, thus simplifying UI validation and eliminating the possibility of users entering
a different type of value.

<script>
	$(function() {
		$( "#datepicker" ).datepicker();
	});
</script>
<p>Date: <input type="text" id="datepicker" /></p>

Book answer
Use the jQuery date widget.

B. How can you preload information and display it as needed?

jQuery also enhances the user experience by enabling you to perform work in the background that will make the application seem more performant. 
Preloading information using the load function, for example, enables you to get objects to the client. You can also preload
images or documents to the local cache, so changing pages seems quicker because much of
the information that would need to be pulled from the server is already available locally.

Book answer
You can convert from the list of buttons to tabs, keeping the look and feel the same.
You can then preload the information by using the jQuery load function and place the
information in the appropriate tab that represents what used to be a separate page.
Taking this route preloads the page so that when a user selects a tab, the content has
already been loaded.

C. When querying for a product, if the product is not found, how can you update
a portion of the search screen rather than creating a pop-up to notify the end
user?

You can use AJAX and PartialViews or ViewComponents to update a portion of the search screen with
the appropriate message. 

Book answer
Use AJAX or jQuery to update the same page if the result is not found.

When thinking of answers to these questions, keep in mind that JavaScript alone
might not be able to fix the situation.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
35)You are creating an ASP.NET MVC web application. The application must accept user input for a ProductName field. To reduce delays due to invalid entries making round trips between the client and server, user input should be validated on the client before being submitted to the server. Which code segment should you choose?

A. 	<div class=”editor-label”>
		@Html.LabelFor(model => model.ProductName)
	</div>
	<div class=”editor-field”>
		@Html.EditorFor(model => model.ProductName)
	</div>
B.
	<div class=”editor-label”>
		@Html.LabelFor(model => model.ProductName)
	</div>
	<div class=”editor-field”>
		@Html.ValidationMessageFor (model => model.ProductName)
	</div>
C.
	<div class=”editor-field”>
		@Html.EditorFor(model => model.ProductName)
		@Html.ValidationMessageFor(model => model.ProductName)
	</div>
D.
	<div class=”editor-label”>
		@Html.LabelFor(model => model.ProductName)
	</div>
	
C EditorFor creates input field for ProductName property, ValidationMessageFor creates validation rules (Based on DataAnnotations that decorate the model)    	
	
Book answer
Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: @Html.EditorFor only inserts data. The data is verified on the server
side.
B. Incorrect: @Html.ValidationMessageFor displays the validation message. There is
no code included in this answer choice to validate the data.
C. Correct: @Html.EditorFor, in combination with @Html.ValidationMessageFor, are
used for client-side validation.
D. Incorrect: @Html.LabelFor only displays labels for the items.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
36) Your team is building an application and you are reviewing the functional specifications.
Your team must include a stockticker in the UI that displays the company’s stock
price every 15 minutes, and include the capability to do partial saves of base objects as
users step through a data entry wizard. You want to use the same approach for both
requirements to make it easier to add functionality and maintain it going forward.
What approach should you use?

A. Use JavaScript to refresh the page every 15 minutes and to manage whether wizard
buttons are enabled or disabled.
B. Use AJAX to make asynchronous calls to the server on a timer for the stock price
and to automatically save the base objects as the user navigates through the
wizard.
C. Use jQuery to refresh the page every 15 minutes and to manage whether wizard
buttons are enabled or disabled.
D. Use data validation annotations on the model to ensure that the stock price is validated
every 15 minutes and that the client saves the base object information after
every wizard step.

B Use a Ajax Function to update a PartialView every 15 min, Use button triggered Ajax function to save data entered in the wizard
when moving to the next view.
 
Book answer
Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: This approach will update the stockticker, but enabling and disabling
the wizard buttons will not ensure that the base objects are saved.
B. Correct: The best way to solve this issue is to use AJAX to do asynchronous calls to
check the stock price as well as manage the save process through the wizard.
C. Incorrect: This approach will update the stockticker, but enabling and disabling
wizard buttons will not ensure that the base objects are saved.
D. Incorrect: Data validation annotations will not meet any of the requirements.  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
37) In which of the following scenarios should you include validation? (Choose all
that apply.)

A. You have an online diary with two form fields, a title, and a large subject box. A
title is not required, and the subject content is stored in a database column with no
maximum size.
B. The web application you maintain has an area that serves as a pass-through to
another company’s web services. The form contains personal information, such
as address and phone number, and is used to set up a profile on the company’s
retirement partner website. The partner has never given you any instructions as to
what is or is not required to be sent to them.
C. Your application is a long wizard that college students use to apply for financial
aid. They do not have access to the application until they are already logged on to
the system so the application knows who they are. Most students will log on many
times to finish the application, so any field might or might not be completed at any
time.
D. You are developing a simple form that helps home brewers keep track of their
process. The form provides two input fields: Date/time and ph level. The Date/
time box needs to be an ordinary text box because people around the world might
enter the date differently, in a way that is meaningful to them. The ph level can be
either a numeric value or a text description.

A, (Subject is required), B(You can't send an empty form to the webservice), C (You need some sort of validation in the fields, else you can get garbage), D which fields are required?

Correct answers: A, B, C, D
A. Correct: You should build in validation to check that at least one field has been
populated before saving an entry.
B. Correct: Although the partner company has not provided any requirements, your
company is responsible for data entry and therefore should ensure that the data
passing through the application meets some minimum criteria.
C. Correct: The application has many entry fields so it is difficult to predict when an
entry hits a valid stage. However, you already know you have constraints on the
data being input because of the size of the database columns in which you will be
storing them. A MaxLength validator on each field would help ensure that there is
no loss of data.
D. Correct: Although either field in the form can be anything, they should have a
maximum length limit imposed so the data does not exceed the size of the database
column they will be stored in. You should also validate that neither field is empty.

38) Your office hosts its internal asset tracking database using an ASP.NET MVC application.
To find contact information for an employee from the Inventory screen, a user
must exit the Inventory screen and launch a User screen. In addition, the current
process takes the user to a separate login screen, but the IT department wants to
be able to log in and out of the application quickly. Your IT manager wants you to
update the application to improve usability.
Answer the following questions for your manager:

1. What can you modify to enable staff to switch screens?

To easily switch screens, you should add navigation links in the navigation panel of the _Layout.chtml.
These navigation links in the header will be visible in all views.     

Book answer
Use AJAX or jQuery to load a partial view that lets you select users and view their
information.

2. What can you modify to achieve quick login and logout functionality?

You can add login/logout functionality as a PartialView or ViewComponent to the _Layout.chtml navigation panel.    
After selecting the login view and successfully login on, the controller action should redirect you to the
page/url where you came from, in order to avoid that the user has to navigate were he came from.    

Book answer
Insert a login/logout partial view on top of the master layout. This partial view enables
you to log in and log out from every screen in the application that uses that master
layout page.

When thinking of answers to these questions, keep in mind that JavaScript alone
might not be able to fix the situation.

D.
	<div class=”float-right”>
		<section id=”contact “>
			@RenderBody()
		</section>
	</div>

B

Book answer
Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: @Html.ActionLink creates a link but does not load a partial view.
B. Correct: @Html.Partial loads a partial view.
C. Incorrect: @RenderPage method inserts one complete page into another This
is not what you are looking to do as you only want the partial view content to be
displayed.
D. Incorrect: @RenderBody inserts views on master layout pages.

Book answer
Correct answer: D
A. Incorrect: The Value construct sets the display information in the element. In addition,
the field is not bound to the model.
B. Incorrect: This will not validate or set the size requirement.
C. Incorrect: This will make the input field display with a placeholder.
D. Correct: This is the proper way to limit the size of a certain field that is being
bound to the model.

41)You are modifying an ASP.NET MVC web application and you have created a new master layout page named _Layout.WindowsPhone.cshtml. You want to use that layout in a new view. Which code segment do you use?

A. @Html.ActionLink(“_Layout.WindowsPhone.cshtml”);
B. Layout=”~/Views/Shared/_Layout.WindowsPhone.cshtml”;
C. Layout=”Layout.WindowsPhone.cshtml”;
D. @Html.Partial(“_Layout.WindowsPhone.cshtml”);

B

Book answer
Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: @Html.ActionLink creates a clickable link and does not do anything to
set the layout.
B. Correct: Layout=”” loads the layout file to be used with that view.
C. Incorrect: Layout=”Layout.WindowsPhone.cshtml“ points to an incorrect view
folder.
D. Incorrect: @Html.Partial loads. a partial view, but does not manage the layout
being used by the page.

42) Your team has been hired to develop an ASP.NET MVC application for an insurance agency. The agency has both office staff and sales staff. Office staff members use Microsoft Surface tablets and sales personnel use iPads. When visiting with clients and prospects onsite, sales personnel must be able to use their devices to check in with the main office to place orders and ask questions of the office staff. The office staff needs to be able to respond to questions, but not ask questions. The applica-tion should also maximize screen real estate on both types of devices.Answer the following questions for your client:

A. What should you do to ensure that both types of devices can use the application?

Make sure that the browsers on the two different devices are able to interact with the ASP.NET MVC application.      
You can create specific views based on the two devices and the browsers they use.
The device and browser information can be retrieved from the useragent info in the http request.      

Book answer
The main way to manage this requirement is to use display mode providers, one for
the iPads and the other for the Windows tablets. You must create a different set of
views based on each device. Using the @media query is complicated because both
types of devices are tablets with similar screen sizes. It is unlikely the viewport will be
different for each.

B. What approach should you take to provide different functionality based on device?

You can return different views based on the useragent content (Webbrowser, device type) in the http request.

Book answer
If you use the different views based off the display mode providers, you can design
a completely different experience for users on each device. You can make different
menus, use different colors—basically design completely different experiences.

C. What kinds of issues could you run into when making functionality issues based on device?

A device such as Microsoft Surface tablets can run different browsers and therefore support different functionality. 

Book answer
There are several problems with making the determination of functionality based on
the type of the device being used. The first is that you lock in a user type to a device
type; for example, a salesperson who breaks or loses his iPad could not work until he
has another iPad. The second problem is that this kind of decision should really be by
user type, not by device.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
43) You want to support the Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Opera web browsers in your application. Which vendor-specific extensions do you need to include with CSS3 properties? (Choose all that apply.)

A. -webkit-
B. -ms-
C. -o-
D. -hp-
E. -moz-

B(Microsoft), C(Opera) and E(Mozilla) 

Book answer
Correct answers: B, C, E
A. Incorrect: The -webkit- prefix is used for Google Chrome and Apple Safari.
B. Correct: The -ms- prefix is used for Internet Explorer.
C. Correct: The -o- prefix is used for the Opera browser.
D. Incorrect: The -hp- prefix is used by Hewlett-Packard.
E. Correct: The -moz- prefix is used for Mozilla Firefox.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
44) What are common methods for detecting the type of browser running on a client? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Use JavaScript to query for the userAgent header.
B. Use the window.addEventListener method.
C. Use the viewport <meta> tag.
D. Use the DisplayMode provider.

A, D 

Book answer
Correct answers: A, D
A. Correct: Using JavaScript to query the userAgent gives you information about the
type of browser being used by the client.
B. Incorrect: The window.addEventlistener does not give any information on the
browser being used by the client, but it can be used to see whether a browser is
HTML5-compliant.
C. Incorrect: The viewport <meta> tag gives access to the visible area of the device;
it does not tell you anything about the device itself.
D. Correct: The display mode provider performs some of the analysis of the HTTP
request to try and determine what kind of browser made the request.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
45) You are creating a different view for each of several different browsers/devices, such as
Home.iemobile.cshtml and Home.IPad.cshtml. What is the best way to implement it so
your application knows to look for the specific views?

A. Use the viewport <meta> tag.
B. Add a new DisplayModeProvider for each of the special view types you want to
support.
C. Put logic into each action to select the appropriate view based on information in
the request.
D. You don’t have to do anything. The framework automatically handles browser/device
detection by reading the new extensions on the views.

B, C (You can inject for example a custom class IDeviceResolver as shown in code below which contains useragent properties)

public class HomeController : Controller
{           
	private readonly IDevice device;   

	public HomeController(IDeviceResolver deviceResolver)
	{                
		this.device = deviceResolver.Device
	}

	public IActionResult Index()
	{
		if(device.Type == DeviceType.Desktop)
		{
		   //some logic
		}
		else if(device.Type == DeviceType.Mobile)
		{
		   //some logic
		}
		else if(device.Type == DeviceType.Tablet)
		{
		   //some logic
		}
	}
 } 

Book answer
Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: The viewport <meta> tag does not do any direction to views; it is
strictly a client-side helper.
B. Correct: Adding a DisplayModeProvider for each type of special view, such as
IEMobile or IPad, informs the framework to use those views where the context
condition is fulfilled.
C. Incorrect: Putting logic into each action could be done, but it would be timeconsuming
and difficult to maintain. The DisplayModeProvider does the work for
you in the background and eliminates the need for special code.
D. Incorrect: The framework does not make any assumptions by itself; it only knows
what to do based on configurations that it has been given.

46) Your team is modifying an ASP.NET MVC application for an automotive dealership.
The company issued Windows phones to sales staff. Office staff members access the
application via their desktop computers to perform data entry, generate reports,
and handle other administrative functions. The mobile devices will be used to
search inventory and to check cars in and out for test drives. The application must
also be viewable in a native user experience relative to the devices.
Answer the following questions for your client:

1. How can you ensure that both types of users have a positive user experience?

Windows phones users and desktop users can have their own views (Index.chtml, Index.iemobile.chtml) that are custom made for them 
to give them the best user experience possible, taking into account the different screen resolutions.      

Book answer
Two separate user groups—admin users and sales users—use two different types of
devices to access the application. You can safely assume that admin users, or users
from any desktop computer should have access to all functionality, whereas mobile
device users need access to only a limited set of functionality. Therefore, you could
start with separate, overridden views because they use different navigation schema.
After you separate mobile users into their own template, you could use jQuery Mobile
to create the UI while working in the mobile section of code.

2. Would adding two more types of mobile clients, such as Android tablets and
iPads, to the list of supported devices change your approach? Why or why not?

If there are a lot of different devices and browsers you can use a CSS Framework such as Bootstrap,
you would then get a CSS driven design, which means that @media elements in the CSS files
use the screen resolution of the client requesting the page to correctly format the webpage returned.

Book answer
When developing a mobile app strategy, remember that mobile apps constantly
evolve, and new mobile devices are available constantly. By using a jQuery Mobile
approach without any specific templates for each mobile device, the framework makes
many decisions for you. Adding supported devices should be almost free for the developer,
outside of testing efforts.

47) You are creating an ASP.NET MVC web application, and you decide to create a new layout for mobile devices with relatively small screens. Which @media query should you create or modify to accomplish the task? (Choose all that apply.)

A. @media (max-width:768px)
B. @media (max-width:478px) and (orientation:portrait)
C. @media (min-width:768px) and (orientation:portrait)
D. @media (min-width:1200px)

B

Book answer
Correct answers: A, B
A. Correct: This allows for devices with a maximum width of 768 pixels.
B. Correct: This allows for devices with a maximum width of 478 pixels in portrait
view, such as tablets.
C. Incorrect: The screen resolution is too large for a typical mobile device.
D. Incorrect: The screen resolution is too large for a typical mobile device.

48)You are modifying an existing ASP.NET MVC web application to incorporate mobile access. What should you do to ensure that mobile devices view mobile-only pages? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Run the Install-Package jQuery.Mobile.MVC command using the Package Manager console.
B. Create a _Layout.Mobile.cshtml master layout page.
C. Create additional views with .Mobile, such as Index.Mobile.cshtml.
D. Create additional views with .Mobile, such as Index.Mobile.cshtml as well as a _Layout.Mobile.cshtml master layout page.

A, D

Book answer
Correct answers: A, D
A. Correct: This installs all the necessary mobile packages.
B. Incorrect: You need the additional views made for mobile calling the master
layout.
C. Incorrect: Just the views alone do not work; you need the master layout as well.
D. Correct: All mobile views and mobile master layout ensure that the page will load
accordingly.

49)You are modifying an ASP.NET MVC web application for a client. The client requires that the application must be viewable on Android devices in a UI format native to the device. What should you do? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Run the Install-Package jQuery.Mobile.MVC command using the Package Manager console.
B. Create a viewport and use @media queries to make styles that are specific for Android.
C. Create corresponding mobile views for the project targeted toward Android.
D. Modify the Web.config file in Shared views in the project to add in support for other browsers.

C (if useragent contains info to identify android devices, you can then use the following code)

DisplayModeProvider.Instance.Modes.Insert(0, new
DefaultDisplayMode("android")
{
	ContextCondition = (context => context.GetOverriddenUserAgent().IndexOf
	("android", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) >= 0)
});

Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: Simply installing the jQuery Mobile package does not provide support
for Android-specific browsers. It enables the application to use the package.
B. Incorrect: By using @media queries and viewport, you can create an Androidreadable
website, but it won’t give an Android-specific UI.
C. Correct: Additional views must be created or ported to fit the smaller layout.
D. Incorrect: You do not have to modify the Web.config file.

50)Your team has created a blog site based on ASP.NET MVC. The site is not ranking
well in Bing searches. Answer the following questions for your manager:

1. What tool can you use to detect major errors in your site and correct them to
improve search engine crawling?

You can validate the website structure using the W3C Validation Service. (https://validator.w3.org/)   
Furthermore you can use Chrome/Edge debugger F12, to see which errors the browser detects.

Book answer
Run the IIS SEO Toolkit or a similar tool.

2. If you implement ARIA in your application, what effect would it have on your
search engine ranking?

The basic concept of Accessible Rich Internet Applications
(ARIA) is to provide additional context to HTML elements and thus to the content they
contain. So therefore the webpages contain more relevant information that
can be used by search engine. Therfore I expect that the search engine ranking 
will be higher when using ARIA in your application.  

Book answer
When properly implemented, ARIA should not have any effect on search engine rankings.
All markup occurs in attributes within the HTML elements.

3. How can you check which parts of the site are slowing down when downloading?
Consider various tools with overlapping feature sets in case one tool misses an issue.

We can use the browser debugger F12, you can use VS profiler/diagnostics to see the response of action methods in controllers.    

Book answer
The Internet Explorer Developer Toolbar is one of several tools you can use to evaluate
the performance of a website. With the toolbar, you can see every HTTP call made
from the browser and determine how long each call takes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
51) You have been asked by the marketing department to help improve your company’s ranking in search engine results. They are particularly concerned about a section of the site that is highly interactive, with extensive mouse-over color, background, and text changes. Without looking at the code, what is the most likely reason for ranking low in search engine results?

A. Unclosed HTML tags
B. Content hidden in JavaScript tags
C. Broken links
D. Excessive number of images

B

Book answer
Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: Although the pages might contain unclosed HTML tags, the highly
interactive nature of the site indicates that the content could be in script files, and
therefore hidden from the search crawler.
B. Correct: Text revealed by mouse-overs not being picked up by search engine
crawlers indicates that content is being skipped.
C. Incorrect: Broken links do not slow down a crawler.
D. Incorrect: The presence of images does not affect the search engine crawler.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
52) You have been asked by a company to evaluate its web application as a user. The company wants you to review the website from outside its network and identify areas that might be problematic. You have been asked to consider SEO and accessibility. Which tools would be helpful for your review? (Choose all that apply.)

A. IIS SEO Toolkit
B. Internet Explorer F12 tools
C. IIS Logging tab
D. Bing Webmaster Toolkit

B, For other options you need to have access to webserver or IIS.

Book answer
Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: The IIS toolkit requires access to the server, and your charge is to perform
the assessment from outside the client’s network.
B. Correct: The Internet Explorer F12 tool enables you view HTML and CSS code,
which can help you detect structural problems or errors that might affect accessibility
or SEO.
C. Incorrect: The IIS Logging tab displays logs related to functioning of a website
and also requires access to the server.
D. Incorrect: The Bing Webmaster Toolkit requires access to the server to put a
special file on to the file system so that Bing can tie a Webmaster account to a
particular site.

53) Your company has joined an industry accessibility group and you are a member. As one of your responsibilities, you have been asked to estimate the time it would take to modify your corporate site for accessibility. What should you consider to properly estimate the required time? (Choose all that apply.)

A. The amount of text in the website
B. The level of current usage of HTML helpers in your views
C. The numbers of controllers in the application
D. The complexity of your data entry forms

B, D

Book answer
Correct answers: B, D
A. Incorrect: The amount of text shouldn’t affect the amount of accessibility work to
be performed. The work will be the same whether there is one word in the ARIAcompliant
element or 100 words.
B. Correct: Because ASP.NET MVC 3 HTML helpers are not ARIA compliant, you need
to write custom HTML helpers or use a different process to create HTML forms.
C. Incorrect: The number of controllers does not affect your need to make the rendered
HTML ARIA compliant.
D. Correct: Because many of the problems with accessibility are related to giving
context to content, complex forms need a thorough review to ensure that labels
and section context are provided for every element on the page.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
54) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application that monitors and tracks exercise
and diet. The application will be released simultaneously in North America and
Europe. Because of the flexibility of the application, you estimate the application
will have more than 50 data entry and reporting screens. The application will be
released in English, Spanish, French, German, Dutch, Italian, and Danish.

1. Would separate views or resource files be the easiest way to implement and
maintain translations?

Separate views eliminate dependency on resource files, but it leads to
code replication. Because there are a lot of data entry and reporting screens
it is recommended to use resource files instead of separate views.    
If you create separate views for each language, it takes a lot of effort in
creating and maintaining the application.   

Book answer
Using separate views to maintain translations would be problematic because there are
more than 350 views to support the initial launch. Although translating a view is easier
than translating a resource file, the creation and maintenance of the additional views
would be a lot of additional work because the view gives context to the translator.

2. You want to use AJAX UI items in various parts of the application. How does that
affect your application’s design as it relates to globalization?

If you have client side logic that diplays text, you need client side globalization. 

Book answer
Using jQuery in the context of AJAX requires some additional work because you have
to add JavaScript globalization to the mix. Although you can use traditional resource
files for any content created on the server side, you need to include the globalization
package in your solution, have the appropriate translated versions of the culture file
available, and provide enough information to the browser about the client’s culture so
the JavaScript globalization features can determine which translated file to display.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
55)You are globalizing an application and are compiling a list of items that need to be
translated. Which items should be included on the list? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Images that are used as part of the menu structure
B. The company logo
C. Server error-logging messages
D. Button tooltips

A D

Book answer
Correct answers: A, D
A. Correct: Images that are being used for menus likely have text displayed on them.
That text should be localized, and extra sets of buttons might have to be created.
B. Incorrect: A company logo should not be changed because it provides brand
awareness.
C. Incorrect: Server error-logging messages are not seen by the user and are instead
an internal item. You should keep them in the default language.
D. Correct: Tooltips are supposed to give extra contextual help about the item the
mouse hovers over. It is important to get them translated.

56) You are creating an ASP.NET MVC website and you want to replace a <h2>hello</h2>
tag within the view with custom resources you have created. What should you use?

A. <h2>@mvcapp.Resources.Home.Index.Heading</h2>
B. <h2 div=”resource”>Hello</h2>
C. <h2 class=”resource”>Hello</h2>
D. <h2>@mvcapp.Resources.Home.Index.Heading Hello</h2>

A

Book answer
Correct answer: A
A. Correct: This is the correct way to insert resources into a view.
B. Incorrect: The <div> tag cannot be used to insert resources into a view.
C. Incorrect: This attempts to style the element, looking for a style named “resource.”
D. Incorrect: Although this

57) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application and you need to create satellite assemblies
from resource files. What code should you use?

A. mage.exe /n: /embed:strings.de-DE.resources MyApp.de-DE.resources.dll
B. WinRes.exe /t: embed:strings.de-DE.resources /culture:de-DE
C. Lc.exe strings.de-DE.resources MyApp.de-DE.resources.dll
D. al.exe /t:lib /embed:strings.de-DE.resources /culture:de-DE /out:MyApp.de-DE.
resources.dll

D

Book answer
Correct answer: D
A. Incorrect: Manifest Generation and Editing Tool is for creation and editing of application
manifests.
B. Incorrect: Windows Form Resource Editor is a visual layout tool for the Windows
Forms user interface.
C. Incorrect: License Compiler reads text license files and compiles them into binary
format.
D. Correct: Assembly Linker generates modules or resource files.

58) You are updating an existing MVC blog site. You are told to add role-based permissions
to the site. Answer the following questions for your manager:

1. The manager wants to add information about currently logged-in users to the
top of each webpage. Can a nonregistered user and registered user experience
the site the same way? Why or why not?

A nonregistered user and registered user can experience the website differently.
Because the application knows when a user is authenticated, therefore the
application can use this information to add a customized experience for the
registered user, it can add for example the login name in the layout header (Welcome username).   

Book answer
Yes, the layout of the site can remain the same. You have to look at two areas: view and
controller. The view needs the capability to display default placeholder information
for nonregistered users. Use the controller to authenticate a user. Pass the information
back to the view and show the required information for registered and logged-in users.
As long as the design is the same with some different options in a similar place for
each type of user, the overall user experience is much the same.

2. You want to ensure that your site is viewable by all but allow only authorized users
to edit. How can you accomplish this?

You can decorate the edit action method with the authorize attribute. 
Furthermore you can hide the edit link for unauthorized users.   

Book answer
To allow for unauthenticated users to view, you need to ensure that there are no
Authorize attributes set on the action. Anywhere authentication is needed, use the
Authorize attribute to filter out unauthenticated users. You can even redirect the page
to a login page so that a person with credentials can log in and post the information as
needed.

3. You have updated the site but can no longer write new blogs, although you can
edit existing blogs. You are logging in as the Administrator role. What could be
the problem?

The action method that creates new blogs does not have the Administrator role in the accepted list.   
Authorize(Roles = Administrator). 

Book answer
Although your roles are set up and you are correctly authenticated, if the information
being returned misses required information, the model state is no longer valid. In that
case, make sure that your model state is valid by manipulating the data before you
insert the object.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
59) You have a set of requirements that expects a particular action to be accessed only through HTTPS by an authenticated user. What is the best way to meet these requirements?

A. Use the Authorize attribute before the RequireHttps filter.
B. Use the RequireHttps attribute before the Authorize filter.
C. Use a custom action filter that combines the check for HTTPS and the check for authentication into a single filter.
D. Use Authorize alone; you do not need to use RequireHttps separately if you already have Authorize, because using Authorize implies the use of HTTPS.

B

Book answer
Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: Although this would solve the requirements, it is not the best way. It is
better to run the RequireHttps filter first because it expends fewer resources than
the Authorization filter.
B. Correct: It filters out those users not on an SSL connection before performing the
more resource-intensive authentication check.
C. Incorrect: A custom action filter that performs both is more complicated to write
than using the standard filters provided with ASP.NET MVC.
D. Incorrect: A user can be authorized and not be connected over HTTPS. The two
are independent and need to be treated as such.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
60) You have written a shareware application and want to sell it on your personal website. You are considering various approaches for distributing the application after users purchase it. Which of the following is the best approach?

A. Use the FileResult action result to initiate the file download.
B. Convert the application to an encoded string and provide it for download through the ContentResult.
C. Create a view or partial view that contains an action link to a route in which the
user can download the file.
D. Create an email containing a link to a route from which the user can download the
file.

A

Book answer
Correct answer: A
A. Correct: The FileResult property was designed for this need.
B. Incorrect: The product being distributed is a binary file and does not successfully
transition to a string format.
C. Incorrect: Creating a link to download the file through the application just
postpones the decision until that link is clicked as it is still going through the
application.
D. Incorrect: Creating a link to download the file in an email just postpones the decision
until that link is clicked as it is still going through the application.

61) You have been tasked with modernizing an application created in ASP 3.0. Part of one
of the pages contains HTML that comes as a string from a third-party application as
part of a service call that populates part of a form. The same form contains input values
for your application. You need to support the same business process as the original
application, but you also want to use some MVC features. What is the approach?

A. Create a single model containing information from your local application. Use
strongly-typed binding as much as possible and manually match the rest of the
fields.
B. Create a single model for the local input fields and the service call input, and use
ToValueProvider to map the entire object.
C. Create a single model. Use weakly-typed binding for the form fields, and the HTML
provided by the third-party application.
D. Create a model that contains only your fields and strongly bind the fields to the
model. Create a second model that maps to the fields in the imported HTML and
bind to that model using ToValueProvider.

B

Book answer
Correct answer: D
A. Incorrect: Although this could conceivably work, it has the misfortune of expecting
manual mapping. It also uses the approach of a single model, and because the
provided HTML input forms might change under you, it makes more sense to use
two models so that the information your application controls is not affected.
B. Incorrect: Although this would work, it uses the single model approach. Because
the provided HTML input forms can change outside of your own release cycle,
it makes more sense to use two models so that the information your application
controls is not affected.
C. Incorrect: You cannot weakly bind to the input fields provided from the third
party because weakly-bound models imply that you have used an HTML helper to
write the information, and you are just giving the helper a hint to the property it
should map to in the model.
D. Correct: The key is separating your data input fields from the provided input
fields. You can strongly-bind to yours because you have full control over the relationship
between your model and your view, and can then use the ToValueProvider
to merge the other model that is tied to the provided input fields.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
62)You are updating an ASP.NET MVC application for a client that sells DVDs and other
types of media. The website manager has identified several issues:

■■ The site includes pages for customers to shop for media as well as pages intended
only for sales team members. Currently, everyone can access both types of pages,
making the site confusing for sales staff and customers alike.
■■ When a user enters information about a product into a web browser’s address bar,
the browser displays a 404 error if the product is no longer available.
■■ The manager wants a particular page to be called in multiple ways through different
URLs.

Answer the following questions for the client:
1. How can you modify the site to make it less confusing to sales team members
and customers?

Create a separate Area for sales, which can be accessed via the sales/ url.
Using areas enables the designer to separate functionality into logical or functional groups. It creates new copies of the Models, Views, and Controllers directories in an Areas directory so you can split the functionality in an appropriate way. Each has its own route management features as well, so one area can define a route different from another area.

Book answer
You can split the site into areas. A staff area can be authenticated against the company’s
employee database. The customer area can display only products customers can
purchase.

2. How can users be redirected to the main page if a product is no longer available
instead of showing them a 404 error?

In the action method that displays the product, return RedirectToAction("Index");  

public IActionResult Details(int id)
{
	Product product = _ProductService.GetProductById(id);
	if(product != null)
	{
		return View(product);
	}
	else //Product not found
	{
		return RedirectToAction("Index");
	}
} 

Book answer
If a certain product line is no longer available and still cached in the search engines,
the route can be rewritten so that default controller and actions are called when the
URL fits a certain type of request rather then causing a 404 error.

3. How can you modify the site so that when a user types http://myurl/movies, for
example, the DVDs for Sale section is displayed?

You can use MapRoute as follows:

routes.MapRoute(
name: "Videos2",
url: "/movies",
defaults: new { controller = "DVD", action = "Index");

You map the specific url to a controller and action.

Book answer
When multiple products can be mapped to the same controller or action, additional
routes can be mapped, and the same controller and/or action can be called for a different
URL request. For example, movies can be mapped to the DVD controller with a
default action.

63)You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application. You have a set of requirements to create a help section for remote users. Your typical help scheme is help/desktop or help/mobile, so logically this section should be help/remote. The change board wants the links in the application to point to the default support site. Which code segment would you use?

A.
routes.MapRoute(
name: “Default”,
url: “{controller}/{action}/{id}”,
defaults: new { controller = “Home”,
action = “Index”, id = UrlParameter.Optional }); 

B.
routes.MapRoute(
“remote”,
“help/remote”,
new { controller = “support”, action = “Index” }
);

C.
routes.MapRoute(
“remote”,
“help”,
new { controller = “support”, action = “Index” }
);

D.
routes.MapRoute(
“remote”,
“remote/help”,
new { controller = “support”, action = “Index” }
);

B

Book answer
Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: This is a default route; it accomplishes nothing.
B. Correct: This is how you add an additional route and point to a different
controller.
C. Incorrect: The URL portion of the new route does not satisfy the question being
asked.
D. Incorrect: The URL portion of the new route is reversed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
64)You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application. You noticed a bug on the DVD controller of the application. You want to ignore the DVD pages until the bug is fixed. What should you do?

A. Add route.SetItem(route.Count, “dvd/”); to the RegisterRoute method.
B. Add route.IgnoreRoute(“dvd/”); to the RegisterRoute method.
C. Add route.Insert(route.Count,“dvd/”); to the RegisterRoute method.
D. Add route.Remove(“dvd/”); to the RegisterRoute method.

B

Book answer
Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: SetItem adds an item to the collection. However, adding a route at the
end of the collection does not solve the problem because it is being added as a
route that should be matched.
B. Correct: IgnoreRoute is the correct statement to use.
C. Incorrect: Insert adds a new route to the collection for matching, but does not
ignore pages.
D. Incorrect: Remove removes a route from the table. More than likely, this is an
implied mapping, so removing the DVD route does not stop the application from
mapping the request to the same action.

65)You are the lead developer on a team that has been working on a large website for months, and several controllers are getting unwieldy (a system too large or disorganized to function efficiently). You do not have that problem with views and models because most of your communications are through AJAX to display snippets of information on the UI. What changes can best help you solve your problem? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Create partial classes for the controllers that have AJAX functionality to create a set of Controller.Ajax.cs files. Put the AJAX-specific functionality in those files.
B. Create an area called AJAX. Move all controllers, models, and views into the area.
C. Create an area called AJAX. Move the specific AJAX functionality into the Controllers directory and leave the Views and Models directories empty.
D. Create a new ASP.NET MVC 4 application project. Move the AJAX functionality into that so that it will be more responsive. 

A C 

Book answer
Correct answers: A, C
A. Correct: Creating partial classes offers some relief to the problem that you are experiencing,
although not as much as a more-functional separation such as offered
by areas. You do not have to make any UI changes, however.
B. Incorrect: You do not want or need to move any views or models. The code clutter
is due to the small discrete actions that support your AJAX site.
C. Correct: Your best move is to separate the AJAX components into an area. You
would have to change all the calls to it, but you would achieve complete separation
of concern for AJAX calls.
D. Incorrect: This would be too drastic a change. It would require a complete change,
from deployment to testing, throughout the entire application stack.

66)You are updating an existing MVC blog site and you want to apply a theme to the
site to create a more modern-looking user interface. You also want to log errors
when a certain page is loaded. Finally, you want to ensure that when a category
such as “recipes” is typed as part of the URL, only content from that category is
displayed. Answer the following questions:

1. How can you create and test the theme without taking down the site or causing
disruptions?

Book answer
You can create themes by adding an additional custom view engine for the site and
show the custom view engine on the test site.

2. What must you modify to ensure that logs are created when a certain action is
executed?

Create and add(decorate the action method with the custom exception attribute) an Exception filter to the specific actionmethod.  
Exception An exception filter implements the System.Web.Mvc.IExceptionFilter and
is run when there is an unhandled exception thrown in the processing of an action
method. It covers the whole lifetime of the action, from the initial authorization filters
through the result filter.

Book answer
To execute a certain custom attribute, you need to create a custom action filter and
run additional code within the OnActionExecuting method you have overridden in the
custom action filter.

3. Currently, the site displays the default list of blog entries, even if you enter a
specific category. You have also modified the action result. What else is missing?

You need to create a custom route handler, that directs URL containing "recipes" to a particular controller and action.     
The default route handler gives the developer a lot of flexibility in defining routes, but sometimes you might need additional or different functionality. ASP.NET MVC 4 enables you to create custom route handlers that support your need to interpret URLs differently. As with the other customization choices, you can either override the existing default functionality to add your required logic or you can completely replace it.

Book answer
Because every contingency has been reviewed, and the controller code is written correctly,
you should check the route. Make sure that additional parameter(s) are included
because the code might be checking against parameters.

67)Your application manages the sale of expensive well-drilling equipment. Your IT director wants you to add functionality that sends an email to a customer’s sales account manager whenever someone from your client company logs in to the system. What is an appropriate solution?

A. Override the AuthorizeAttribute and apply it to the login action. Run the base method first to handle the authentication and then evaluate the status of the request. If the user is a customer, send the email.
B. Create a custom action filter that is globally defined and overrides the OnActionExecuting method. This action filter evaluates the status of the user and sends the email if it is a customer.
C. Override the AuthorizeAttribute that is applied to the login action, check for the user’s authentication status, and determine whether it is a customer prior to sending it to the base authentication method.
D. Create an action filter that overrides the OnActionExecuted method and apply it to the login action. This action filter evaluates the status of the user and sends the email if it is a customer. 


Book answer
Correct answer: D
A. Incorrect: You should not have an AuthorizeAttribute on your login action, because
it ensures that users have to be authenticated before they log in. Users can
never log in to the site.
B. Incorrect: Because this filter is applied globally, it sends the email every time the
user takes an action, rather than just once per visit.
C. Incorrect: You should not have an AuthorizeAttribute on your login action because
it ensures that users have to be authenticated before they log in. Users can never
log in to the site.
D. Correct: This is be applied only because the user is leaving the login section of the
application, at which point you also know whether they have been authenticated.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

68)You work for a financial services company that deals with many small brokers. Your executives want to be able to run a report that details all the actions taken by the brokers on the site as a form of auditing and protection. Neither the application nor system currently stores this kind of information. Which of the following are viable solutions? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Create a globally applied custom action filter that implements the OnActionExecuting method. Have it store the user, the URL, and the forms collection. 
B. Create a globally applied custom action filter that implements the OnActionExecuting method. Have it store the user, the URL, and the forms collection.
C. Create a globally applied custom action filter that implements the OnActionExecuted method. Set the AllowMultiple parameter to false in the filter. Have it store the user, the URL, and the forms collection.
D. Override the AuthorizeAttribute and have it store the user, the URL, and the forms collection.

A

Book answer
orrect answers: A, C
A. Correct: Creating a globally applied action filter enables you to save the state of
every action taken by the user while logged in to your site.
B. Incorrect: By setting the AllowMultiple to false, you have configured the filter to
be run only once during the lifetime of the application.
C. Correct: By creating a globally applied action filter you have ensured that every
action taken by the user will be logged.
D. Incorrect: Because this is applied only to the AuthorizeAttribute, it logs only those
actions where the user has to be logged in. That enables them to take actions that
might not be logged.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
69) You are adding the capability for users to customize their site’s display colors. You are required to provide a slider that enables users to change each RGB element. What can you do to ensure that this gets treated in the model and stored in the database as a single RGB color? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Strongly bind the sliders to their own individual fields in the model. Ensure that the model unit for color only implements the GET, where you write code that concatenates the values.
B. Create a custom model binder that knows to look for the three values and how to put them together to get the single color.
C. Add the three different elements to the model and ensure that your update statement to the database correctly joins the elements to get the appropriate color.
D. Create a custom model binder that evaluates the entire color customization process and binds the entire model rather than just managing a subset of the information.

B, C

Book answer
Correct answers: B, D
A. Incorrect: This does not easily enable saving into the database because the color
itself only implements the HTTP Get.
B. Correct: This solution works because it combines the three discrete values into a
single object on the model.
C. Incorrect: Although this solution gets the value into the database appropriately, it
does not fulfill the requirement that the model be able to use the color as a single
value.
D. Correct: Although it takes more work, using an approach of creating a model
binder for the entire object, rather than just a part, successfully manages the need
to have it in the model and in the database.

70)  You are troubleshooting an ASP.NET MVC site hosted in Chicago. A client in Hong
Kong SAR reports that the site is slow. Answer the following questions to help
resolve the problem:

1. What tool should you use to determine how long each item is taking to load?

You can use the webbrowser debugger F12, to see load times of the website items.  

Book answer
The Internet Explorer F12 tool can tell you how long each asset is taking to load.
Remember that only six items can be pulled from a host at a time. Depending on the
time required for downloading, you have to figure out how to resolve the situation.

2. To make the site load faster, which assets can you modify, and how?

You can use bundling (reduces the number of concurrent connections needed to download scripts, js css) 
You can use minification, reduce file size of files such as js and css files.  
You can use website compression where possible.

Book answer
You can minify and bundle JavaScript and CSS assets so they can be loaded more
quickly in a browser.

3. You believe a CDN will improve performance. What should you check?

Measure the number network hops it takes from the server to the client in Hong Kong.
See if there are CDN servers in the surrounding of Hong Kong.    

Book answer
Although CDNs can help, make sure that you know where the CDN servers are located
as well as where the clients are placed. The closer the client is to the server, the shorter
the distance the data has to travel.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
71)You are working on a AJAX-heavy site, and your script files are separated in your solution by function. You have already implemented minification and bundling, but you are still getting reports of poor performance when users try to access your pages. You cannot replicate the problem locally. What additional steps can you take and still provide the same user experience?

A. Compress all scripts locally and have the users download the compressed files rather than the uncompressed files.
B. Turn IIS compression on, turn on the option to compress dynamic pages, and set the minimum file size to 0 so that every file served will be compressed.
C. Turn IIS compression on, disable dynamic page compression, and set the minimum file size to the size of your smallest bundled script file.
D. There is nothing more to do without redesigning the site.

C

Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: Although you might be able to minimize the size of the files being
downloaded, your browser cannot open and use those files.
B. Incorrect: This approach minimizes the size of the files being sent to the client, but
it also has a heavy cost on both server-side and client-side processing because the
server tries to compress every file.
C. Correct: This is an appropriate next step to try to compress the script and style
files being sent to the client.
D. Incorrect: IIS compression has not yet been tried. It makes more sense to try all
other solutions before approaching a code rewrite.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
72)You want to implement bundling and minification in your site. What are some of the potential problems you need to be aware of? (Choose all that apply.)

A. None; there is no condition in which this is a poor decision.
B. You need to be sure you do not bundle too many scripts together because you cannot take advantage of concurrent downloads if only one or two files are being downloaded.
C. You should bundle and minimize scripts and CSS files together for maximum effectiveness.
D. Not bundling logically linked scripts together can have a negative effect on performance.

D

Correct answers: B, D
A. Incorrect: Poor decisions in implementing bundling and minification can hurt
performance rather than help it.
B. Correct: Bundling every script into a single large file might decrease the effectiveness
of concurrent downloading.
C. Incorrect: You should keep scripts and CSS files separated for maximum effectiveness.
They represent different aspects of the user experience, so a logical separation,
even on the client side, makes sense.
D. Correct: Not separating scripts logically might lead to the user downloading
scripts that will never be used. Although the download experience is maximized, it
does not make sense to download unused scripts.

73) Your U.S.-based company recently opened an office in England. Staff members have been making lots of sales calls, which have generated an increase in visits to the company’s websites. Much of the activity involves downloading sales sheets, product descriptions, and other sales support information currently stored in PDFs. There have been some performance-related complaints from remote sales staff, but no local users have noticed any problems. Which of the following are potential solutions? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Bundle and minify the PDF files to ensure that there is no wasted space.
B. Write an action result that takes a file name and returns a compressed version of the file for download.
C. Sign on with a CDN with nodes in North America and Europe and use it to serve files and other static content to sales support staff.
D. Add two additional servers and create a server farm to serve your content.

B C

Correct answers: B, C
A. Incorrect: Bundling would create unreadable files because it would concatenate
PDF files inappropriately.
B. Correct: This solution causes more work on the client side to open and view the
compressed content, but it provides a more responsive user experience.
C. Correct: Moving the part of the site most affected by the new usage closer to the
users increases their download speed and thus their perceived performance.
D. Incorrect: Because local users have not noticed a reduction in performance, it is
unlikely that adding more cycles at the server level would improve the responsiveness
of the application for remote users.

74) Maintaining data integrity is important to the success of any ASP.NET MVC 4 application.
It is especially critical when working on a data-intensive application, like a
point-of-sales application.

A. What are some tools that help you prevent data corruption?

You can use Code contracts to ensure that your data falls within the required value, 
and hence data integrity is ensured.

Book answer
Several tools can help you maintain the integrity of your data. The first is parameter
checking, in which you throw an ArgumentException. Another is the use of code contracts
to perform a check on the values going into and coming out of the application.

B. What are some tools you can use to diagnose whether data corruption has
occurred?

Code contracts provide info on which Preconditions, Invariants and Postconditions are not met. 
Furthermore you can use Logging, Tracing and debugging to log data and analyse it whether data corruption has occurred.  

Book answer
Several tools can give you an idea of what is happening with your data. You can’t depend
solely on errors for the information you need because the data might be wrong
without throwing errors. You can add helpful information to logging messages, as well
as details on the parameters coming into a method and the return values out of the
method. This information helps you understand problems in the system. You can also
take the same approach with tracing.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
75)Your application has an intermittent issue, based on the user’s path through the application,
in which the application seems to stop running. Even when running in debug
mode, the application calls a web service and then stops. The application locks and the
call never returns, thus the user’s request is never completed and eventually times out.
What performance or profiling tool will provide the most pertinent information about
your application?

A. CPU sampling in the Performance Wizard
B. Memory allocation in the Performance Wizard
C. Resource contention data in the Performance Wizard
D. Tracing from the System.Diagnostics namespace that logs the times of web service
call and web service return
E. The Health Monitoring tool, for capturing security information related to the interaction
with the web service

C

Book answer
Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: CPU sampling will not provide assistance for the main problem of the
application locking up.
B. Incorrect: Memory analysis will not provide assistance for the main problem of
the application locking up.
C. Correct: Thread and resource profiling will give some understanding of what kind
of actions are taking place that will cause a resource or thread to be blocked.
D. Incorrect: Tracing information regarding when a web service starts and stops
would be interesting. However, the problem is that the web service is called and
never returns, so this logging information would not be complete or useful.
E. Incorrect: A problem with security information would likely not cause the service
to stop responding.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
76)You inherited a working application that began as a proof of concept but was eventually adopted as a production application without being refactored. Many new requirements need to be added. As part of your initial analysis, you notice a lot of problems with bad data. Which solutions will help remediate this issue? (Choose all that apply.) 

A. Running the Performance Wizard to sample CPU usage
B. Adding code contracts to ensure that the input parameters have expected values
C. Adding code contracts to ensure that the return values meet specific criteria
D. Adding code contracts to ensure that objects do not become invalid during process
E. Running the Visual Studio profiler to analyze application flow

B, C and D

Correct answers: B, C, D
A. Incorrect: The Performance Wizard does not support management or identify
data issues.
B. Correct: Preconditional code contracts ensure that incorrect information is not
submitted to a method. This helps eliminate the possibility of bad data.
C. Correct: Postconditional code contracts ensure that incorrect information is not
returned from a method. This helps eliminate the possibility of bad data.
D. Correct: Invariant code contracts ensure that objects do not get to an invalid state.
This helps eliminate the possibility of bad data.

77) You are helping a client estimate the effort involved in adding comprehensive monitoring to an enterprise-level ASP.NET MVC application. Which of the following are useful considerations while building the estimate? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Adding health monitoring involves many choices. An evaluation will have to be performed to determine which monitors will be of real use.
B. Adding generic logging can be done as part of the rework. After the logging pattern has been established, you can add logging as part of any new work and as part of the refactoring process.
C. Adding tracing must be done completely and comprehensively before it can be of any use. There is no point in implementing tracing in a single part of the application if you are not going to refactor the application.
D. Creating a data collection set in Performance Monitor will provide all the needed information and can be set up in a few minutes.

A B

Correct answers: A, B
A. Correct: Adding health monitors is an easy task. Determining which options provide
the information you need will be time-consuming because of the number of
choices.
B. Correct: Generic logging is a useful addition and can be added as items are refactored;
it is not an all-or-nothing type of work.
C. Incorrect: You can perform tracing on an ad-hoc basis as needed.
D. Incorrect: Data collection in Performance Monitor is relatively simple. However,
determining the most critical items to monitor can be time-consuming because
there are hundreds of counters.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
78) You are writing an application to be used by your company’s support staff to manage
the configuration of many custom applications used throughout the enterprise.
Your users are power users who will provide tier 1 support for the application you
are building.

1. How should you treat error handling, considering the application is for support
staff?

The application should log errors to file (or other persistence media) so that the
support staff can send the log file or link to the power users (tier 1 support) for
analysis.    

Book answer
You should treat exception handling as robustly as possible, regardless of the audience.
It is a best practice to try to eliminate and/or remediate issues as soon as they happen.

2. Should you include as much information as possible about each error, including
tables with values and other information? Why or why not?

You should include as much detailed information as possible in the logfile, because support to the application
is provided by power users, the more info they get the better analyses they can make.  

Book answer
No. None of the information should be displayed in an error page outside of the development
environment. Although these users are support staff for multiple applications,
it is possible they are not fully accredited administrators across all the applications with
which you are interfacing. You should treat logging and information display the same
as if the users were not support staff. However, although you should not display the
information in the UI to the user, you need to capture the necessary logging information
to help technical staff troubleshoot issues.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
79) You are re-creating an application that was originally built with ASP 2.0. You need to break the monolithic application into a traditional three-tier application. One of the requirements is that database errors must be displayed in the UI. Which solution will present enough information to the user so they can notify the appropriate person of a problem, but not allow the user to gain information about the design of the database?

A. Add a first chance exception handler and log the information in the error.
B. Add a generic database-layer exception handler to the business layer, and pass appropriate error information to the UI layer for display in a custom error page.
C. Add specific database exception handlers in the business layer and log the information into the database for further review.
D. Let the errors pass through the business layer to the UI layer where they can be handled as specific errors and presented as appropriate in the UI.

B

Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: Although logging information is an important consideration, it does not
provide additional information to the users.
B. Correct: The business layer is the appropriate place to manage data layer exceptions.
By repackaging it and sending it up to the user layer, you can maintain
separation of concerns and meet the requirement to display information to the
user. This will also enable you to log the information as necessary to support debugging.
C. Incorrect: You are having the business layer handle the database exception correctly,
but you are not meeting the requirement to provide information about the
error to the user.
D. Incorrect: By not having the business layer capture and handle the error, you are
building an improper relationship between the UI and the database.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
80)What is an advantage to using first chance exception notification?

A. The ability to capture and handle all exceptions that occur within the application in one place
B. The ability to log an exception after it is handled by its appropriate error handling code
C. The ability to log an exception before it is touched by any other error handler
D. The ability to forward an exception to an error handler based on the type of exception that was thrown

C

Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: First chance exception is a notification only. It does not let you do anything
other than observe the exception.
B. Incorrect: The first chance exception handler gets the exception before it has
been issued to its appropriate error management code. You cannot see what happens
to the exception as it is being handled.
C. Correct: The first chance exception handler enables you to examine an exception
and take some action before it is touched by any other handler.
D. Incorrect: The first chance exception handler can examine the exception, but cannot
forward or handle the exception.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
81) Using custom error pages provides a lot of flexibility to an application because it allows for a consistent user experience even when the application has a problem. To take full advantage of this flexibility, you need to be able to create the pages and configure the application to use these pages. What code will provide custom error pages for 404 errors and general exceptions?

A.
<system.web>
	<customErrors mode=”RemoteOnly” defaultRedirect=”Error/GeneralException”>
		<error statusCode=”404” redirect=”ErrorController.Status404” />
	</customErrors>
</system.web>

B.
<system.web>
	<customErrors mode=”RemoteOnly” defaultRedirect=”Error/GeneralException”>
		<error statusCode=”404” redirect=”Error/Status404” />
	</customErrors>
</system.web>
<system.webServer>
	<httpErrors errorMode=”Detailed” />
</system.webServer>

C.
<system.web>
	<customErrors mode=”RemoteOnly”>
		<error statusCode=”404” redirect=”Error/Status404” />
		<error statusCode=”GeneralException” redirect=”Error/GeneralException” />
	</customErrors>
</system.web>
<system.webServer>
	<httpErrors errorMode=”Detailed” />
</system.webServer>

D.
<system.web>
<customErrors mode=”LocalOnly” defaultRedirect=”Error/GeneralException”>
	<error statusCode=”404” redirect=”Error/Status404” />
</customErrors>
</system.web>
<system.webServer>
	<httpErrors errorMode=”Detailed” />
</system.webServer>

B

Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: This shows only the <system.web> part of the configuration. There is
also a need to have an entry in the <system.webServer> node.
B. Correct: This example shows the 404 error status and it sets the default error handler
to the server error action.
C. Incorrect: This example shows the general exception handler using a status code
of GeneralException. The status codes relates to the type of HTTP error that will be
handled.
D. Incorrect: The custom error mode is set to mode=”LocalOnly”, which means that
users will not see the actual error pages.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
82) You work with a team that is upgrading an ASP.NET Web Forms application to an
ASP.NET MVC 4 application and adding enhancements. The look, feel, and navigation
of the application will remain the same, but the underlying structure must be
modified in anticipation of future features.

The business rules that are part of the application are poorly documented and complicated.
The team is starting to run behind schedule. They have stopped working
on new functionality, but they are continuing the migration.

1. To add testing support, where would it make the most sense for you to start?

You can start with the data layer and work up to the business layer. 

Book answer
Because you are not knowledgeable about the business rules, and because the user
flow and navigation will remain the same, you can quickly bring the most value by
starting web tests. Unit tests validate the software one method at a time. However,
web tests enable you to evaluate the correctness of whole business flows at a time.
If web tests fail, you can use unit tests to help you find where logic issues might be
occurring.

2. Can you create valid unit tests without a complete understanding of the business
rules being tested?

In order to create test cases you need to know the expected result of a certain call,
therefore you need to know the business rules. Unless the functions you are testing 
have a clear defined input and resulting output, in that case you can test the function
without any further knowledge of the business rules.  

Book answer
Conceptually, you can create a unit test without understanding the business requirements.
However, you are assuming that the method performs all the logic appropriately.
This means the unit tests are meant to ensure that other changes in the software
do not affect the methods being tested instead of just ensuring that the application is
correct. Both have their places, however, especially if the application has already been
tested for correctness through other means. In that case, assuming that the functionality
is correct is not the same risk as joining an application in progress.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
83)You are under contract with a large company that is starting to implement a TDD approach. As part of the long-term support for this effort, the company needs you to complete several unit tests. As you review the current code base, you find good tests for the model, but no tests for anything other than the model. Which of the following is the best approach to complete the unit tests?

A. Create a new directory in the unit test project for the controller- and action-specific tests. Create a unit test file for each controller. Inside that file, have one or more tests for only the controller action methods.
B. Add a new file to the unit test project called ControllerTests. Put all tests for all the controllers and the actions in the file.
C. Create a new directory in the unit test project for the controller- and action-specific tests. Create a unit test file for each action you are going to test.
D. Create a new directory in the unit test project for the controller- and action-specific tests. Create a unit test file for each controller. Inside that file have one or more tests for all methods in the controller, regardless of whether they are an action or not.

D

Correct answer: D
A. Incorrect: There might very well be nonaction methods in a controller. Those
methods should be tested as well.
B. Incorrect: You should provide much more separation of your tests than using a
single file for every unit test that applies to a controller.
C. Incorrect: This is too much of a breakdown. The best relationship between controllers
and the applicable unit tests is usually 1 to 1. However, a controller with a
large number of methods working within the controller will not meet the 1-to-1
ratio. You should test nonaction methods in the controller as well.
D. Correct: This solution provides for testing actions and nonactions as well as a
good split of the tests per file.

84) Your ASP.NET MVC web application has just been released to a group of pilot users. The users are reporting periods of extreme performance degradation. You did not encounter performance issues during development or the quality assurance phase. What can you do in your development environment to understand what is occurring in the production environment?

A. Create a set of unit tests that repeatedly test certain parts of the application. Run them continuously over a period of time to ensure that the application works as expected.
B. Create a set of web tests that exercise the application. Set a run load of 50 percent of your pilot users and run them in a constant load testing process to validate the application’s behavior.
C. Create a set of web tests that exercise the application. Using a step approach, start with a minimal number of users and increase to the total number of users in the pilot program.
D. Create a set of web tests that exercise the application. Using a goal-based approach, set the process to run to 75 percent CPU utilization. When you reach that point, compare the results with the number of users in the pilot program.

C You can check if the problems are caused by an increased amount of sessions. 

Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: Unit tests are designed to ensure that the functionality and logic of
the application are correct. They do not work well when you need a performancebased
analysis.
B. Incorrect: Although this test will provide some useful and interesting information,
running a constant load of 50 percent might not give you the information you
need. More users could use the application at any point in time.
C. Correct: Starting from a midlevel count of users and then increasing to the total
number of possible numbers should give you an idea of what is happening during
the day-to-day running of the application in production.
D. Incorrect: Understanding the number of users required to reach 75 percent
utilization of the CPU might be interesting, but it does not help you understand
the users’ issue. They might be experiencing slowness due to memory utilization or
threading contention that this approach will not be able to detect.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
85) You support hardware purchasing for an ASP.NET MVC application in your company. The application is finished, and the development team knows the number of intended users. Which approach will give the team the best understanding of the application’s hardware needs?

A. Create several web tests that exercise all parts of the application, including all static pages. Run these tests in a constant load at various levels to see the effect on performance.
B. Create several web tests that exercise all parts of the application, including all static pages. Run these tests in a step approach up to the maximum expected number of users. This will give you an idea of the load one server can handle.
C. Create several web tests that exercise all parts of the application, including all static pages. Run these tests in a goal-based approach in which the percent of CPU usage and percent of memory usage metrics are set to the company standard maximums. Evaluate how many users it takes to reach the maximum levels.
D. Create several web tests that exercise only the dynamic parts of the application, ignoring all static content. Run these tests in a goal-based approach in which the percent of CPU usage and percent of memory usage metrics are set to the company standard maximums. Evaluate how many users it takes to reach these maximum levels.

C

Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: Running at a constant load, even at various levels of user count, will not
efficiently give them the information that they need.
B. Incorrect: Although this approach will give them interesting information and an
understanding of the capacity of a server, it is based less on statistical information
than on a subjective analysis of performance.
C. Correct: This approach will give them an objective analysis of the amount of users
a server can manage at a particular level of memory or CPU usage.
D. Incorrect: This approach leaves out static pages. For a true test, you should exercise
all parts of the application.

86)Your company wants to run a test project for hosting an ASP.NET MVC application
in the cloud. Management is not sure whether it is the appropriate solution, so they
want to ease into it and see how it goes. You have been asked to make your application
work when hosted in a Windows Azure Virtual Machine (VM). Your application
depends on other sources, such as supplier systems, for information used within the
system, which results in a lot of logging and other transactional tracing within the
application. Although your application must work in Windows Azure, you are not
supposed to eliminate the ability to work outside of Windows Azure.

A. Your application uses a third-party logging tool to write to logs that are stored
on the local file system. Most methods in the application reference this tool. It
will not work when deployed on Windows Azure. What do you need to change?

You can add the the third-party logging tool to the WindowsAzure Diagnostics.
,in order to accomplishe this you need to configure the ServiceDefinition.csdef file
and the ServiceConfiguration.cscfg file so that that the logging 
tool can access databases or other business needs. 
The information gathered from this tool needs to be saved outside of the role, 
because after stopping/restarting of role logging content will be lost. 
The most common location is in one of Windows Azure’s storage accounts. 
You can have the diagnostic information written directly to the storage, 
move the logs manually on demand, batch copy the logs on a schedule, 
or have the logging information retained in the role and then copied out during the role shutdown process.

Book answer
The use of third-party logging tools is complicated by the virtual nature of the Windows
Azure VM. However, you can take certain approaches to mitigate the risk of
losing logging data. One approach is to configure your logging subsystem to write the
logging data to files that are external to your VM, such as in a Windows Azure storage
account or in one of the Windows Azure database providers. If that is not possible,
create a log transference job in which a process moves the logs or writes them into
another storage option regularly, such as every 10 minutes. All this work can be done
outside of the application and will not affect the application’s capability to run in a
non-Windows Azure system.

B. What Windows Azure diagnostic tools can you include in your application
without having to make any code changes that would affect the application’s
capability to run in a non-Windows Azure environment?

Windows event logs, performance counters and crash dumps.

Book answer
You can include many of the Windows Azure diagnostic tools in the application without
affecting the code base. The entire diagnostics framework, for example, can be set
up by adding some additional files that would be meaningless to applications stored
in a non-Windows Azure system. The ability to run remote IntelliTrace is also allowed
without having to create any changes in the application’s source code. You can also use
RDP to help you debug in Windows Azure.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
87)You will be deploying your application in Windows Azure. You know that you need to include logging, but you have some concerns. 
What diagnostic capabilities can Windows Azure support? (Choose all that apply.)

A. The capability to turn on and off different aspects of the Windows Azure diagnostics through configuration changes
B. The capability to retain logs from your custom logging solution on a Windows Azure storage account
C. The capability to retain logs from your custom logging solution when written to a local store
D. The capability to send entries to the Windows Azure diagnostics system from within your application

A, B, D

Correct answers: A, B, D
A. Correct: You can control the diagnostics setting through configuration within your
Windows Azure–hosted application.
B. Correct: Although the Windows Azure VMs get recycled when the role restarts,
saving the logs to the Windows Azure storage system outside of your VM would
ensure that they are available.
C. Incorrect: Because the Windows Azure VMs are entirely virtual and recycle whenever
a role restarts, there is a significant chance you will lose logging information.
D. Correct: You can treat the Windows Azure diagnostics system like a traditional
logging tool by writing messages to the system.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
88) What do you need to do to use IntelliTrace from within Windows Azure? (Choose all that apply.)

E. Download and view the IntelliTrace logs through Visual Studio Ultimate 2012.

A, B, E 

Correct answers: B, E
A. Incorrect: You can enable IntelliTrace only through Visual Studio Ultimate 2012
edition.
B. Correct: When publishing the projects, you can configure the process to deploy in
debug mode with IntelliTrace enabled.
C. Incorrect: There are no Web.config changes required to run the system with IntelliTrace
turned on.
D. Incorrect: You cannot download and run the IntelliTrace logs through a web
browser. Running them requires Visual Studio Ultimate 2012.
E. Correct: You can view the IntelliTrace logs through Visual Studio after download.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
89) You want to configure Windows Azure diagnostics. Where do you configure the specific Performance Monitors you want to have run in support of your application?

A. ServiceDefinition.csdef
B. ServiceConfiguration.cscfg
C. Diagnostics.wadcfg
D. Web.config

C

Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: You include diagnostics in a project using the ServiceDefinition.csdef
file. The file does not configure which monitors will be included when your application
is running.
B. Incorrect: You configure log storage locations in the ServiceConfiguration.cscfg
file. The file does not configure which monitors will be included when your application
is running.
C. Correct: You configure specific monitors that will run in your application in the
Diagnostics.wadcfg file.
D. Incorrect: The Web.config file is not used to include Windows Azure diagnostics in
an application.

90)You have been asked to perform an evaluation of an application your company
wants to implement. The application’s developers claim to have field-level encryption
of every point of data in the database. As you investigate this claim, you realize
that every column in the database, other than keys, is encrypted prior to being
saved in the database using a symmetric key unique to each user. The application
guarantees this uniqueness by creating a randomized salt that is hashed and then
used as the key for that unique user.

1. What is the primary advantage of this approach?

To protect data from unauthorized access in case hackers stole database data.

Book answer
The most significant advantage of this approach is that even if the database is hacked,
the data inside has additional security because of the encryption. As long as the
implementation is competent and secure, even if the database is copied out of your
network, getting useful information out of the system will be exponentially more complicated
than if the data was not encrypted.

2. What are some disadvantages of this approach?

You need to keep track of a lot of symmetric keys.

Book answer
There are several disadvantages of this approach. The first is that you lose the advantage
of strong-typing in your database because all data will need to be stored
as CHAR, VARCHAR, or a blob type. Another disadvantage is reduced performance
because each piece of information you access will need to be decrypted before presentation
and encrypted before saving. Finally, although this solution offers enhanced
security, it also makes other kinds of data access more complicated. Imagine trying to
add a third-party reporting tool, or scripting data changes in this environment. Because
all data will be encrypted, you will have to insert code to decrypt the data before
being able to do any reporting or scripting.

3. Do you think the advantage outweighs the disadvantages? Why or why not?

I think one symmetric key to encrypt all the data is sufficient, keeping track of all the different keys could be a challenge.
Furthermore if all the symmetric key are kept in one location, it means that stealing one key amounts to the same effort as stealing all the different keys.
Therefore using a unique symmetric key for each user does not provide a lot more additional security than when using one key.           

Book answer
Although the concept of encrypting every field in the database is intriguing, the
drawbacks are too extreme to make it practical. If any other tools need to access the
database, they would need some way to decrypt the data as well before being able to
do anything with the information. It would be difficult to recommend using a solution
in which every piece of data is encrypted for such an important piece of the business
process.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
91) What class handles the actual data encryption?

A. RijndaelManaged
B. RSACryptoServiceProvider
C. CryptoStream
D. RSAKeyInfo

C

Correct answer: C
A. Incorrect: RijndaelManaged is a method of encryption and does not create a
stream.
B. Incorrect: RSACryptoServiceProvider does not provide a stream.
C. Correct: CryptoStream provides access to an encrypted stream.
D. Incorrect: RSAKeyInfo contains information for managing an RSA key and does
manage encryption.

92) What are digital signatures used for? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Encryption
B. Authentication
C. Nonrepudiation
D. Authorization
E. Hashing

B, C, D

Correct answers: B, C, D
A. Incorrect: Encryption is not a valid reason for digital signing.
B. Correct: Authentication is a reason for digital signing because it uniquely defines
the party signing the data.
C. Correct: Nonrepudiation is a reason for digital signing because it uniquely defines
the party signing the data and shows that it had to be the original party that submitted
the data.
D. Correct: Authorization can be determined after the individual is uniquely defined.
E. Incorrect: Hashing is not a valid reason for digital signing.

D. aspnet_regiis -pd “Web.Config” -app “/MachineDPAPI” -prov “RsaProtectedConfigurationProvider”

A

Correct answer: A
A. Correct: This is the proper way to encrypt the <connectionStrings> setting of the
Web.config file.
B. Incorrect: This command encrypts more than the <connectionStrings> section of
the Web.config file.
C. Incorrect: This command decrypts the <connectionStrings> section of the Web.
config file.
D. Incorrect: This command decrypts rather than encrypts information, and more
information than just the <connectionStrings> section.

94) You are working with a company that recently had their database for their custom intranet system cracked by hackers. The company has determined that its 10-year-old system had several flaws that allowed the breach to occur. One of the primary vulnerabilities the company discovered was that the application stores users’ passwords in clear text. The company is refactoring its application to eliminate the vulnerability. One of its requests is for the application to use salted and hashed passwords. Although company decision makers know salted and hashed passwords are necessary, they cannot agree where to keep the salt. One party feels that keep-ing the salts in a separate column of the Users table is sufficient, whereas another party feels that it should be kept in a second, differently credentialed database that is used only for saving and retrieving salts.

1. What are the advantages of storing the salts in a separate database?

If the the database which contains the hash value is hacked, the hackers will not also have access to the salt value
which makes it for hackers difficult to backtrack the original password, because it consists of the password and a random salt value. 

Book answer
Getting access to the salts stored in a separate database requires hackers to hack two
different databases to get access to the salt and the salted password. Storing them in
the same table as the password, or even another table of the same database, would
mean that when hackers gain access to the database, they will have access to both the
salt and the password hash. Because security includes the process of making hacking
into the system too expensive or time-consuming to be worth it, doubling the amount
of access a hacker would have to gain should make the system more secure.

2. What are the advantages of storing the salts in the same database?

More easy access to the salts because they are in the same database, you dont need to establish two connections. 

Book answer
Ease of use is the primary reason for keeping the salts in the same database as the
hashed passwords. You would not have to ensure that two databases are always available
at the same time, and always in sync. The advantage of having a salt is minimal if
each user has a randomized salt because although it might make discovery of an individual’s
password easier, the amount of force necessary to crack the passwords of the
system overall will be high. In this level of discussion, that is really what the expectation
is: to protect the passwords. If the hackers have acquired a copy of the database, your
application data is already compromised. At this point, the issue is to mitigate users’
risks because of the potential of shared passwords.

3. Which would you recommend?

I would definitly choose to store the salt in a separate database in order to enhance security. 

Book answer
The requirement of maintaining two separate linked, databases is extensive. Granted, it
adds the perception of security, but the only advantage that it gives is that it protects
a password, a single element of data. If every field in the database were individually
encrypted, and this same salt was used for that, it would make more sense to store it
separately from the data because the basic security of your system is enhanced.

97)A SQL injection attack occurs when an application allows input submitted by the client to be run as part of a SQL command. What actions should a developer take to ensure that this doesn’t happen? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Use Entity SQL because it does not suffer from the same risk.
B. Use SQLParameters to submit the parameters.
C. Use Linq-to-Entities to access the database,
D. Filter out keywords and symbols.

B C

Correct answers: B, C
A. Incorrect: Entity SQL is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, so you would have to
take the same steps to protect an application using it for the data layer.
B. Correct: Using SQLParameters is the best way to manage this risk.
C. Correct: Linq-to-Entities uses an object model as access into the data layer, so the
risk is mitigated.
D. Incorrect: This approach is dangerous because you might end up filtering out
parts of the content. It is also a blocked-list approach; an accepted list is more
secure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
98)One of your clients is in the environmental sciences. The client runs its labora-tory information management (LIMS) system on a mainframe computer with dumb terminal access. The client wants to build an intranet site and migrate some business processes to computers running Windows Server. Currently, the user management system runs within the LIMS. The client will either migrate the LIMS last, or keep the LIMS on the mainframe and access the user management system from Windows as an ordinary database.

A. What is the easiest way to solve the business problem of authenticating against the LIMS? 

The dumb terminals that access the LIMS are currently authenticated using the user management system that runs within the LIMS.
You can use the user management system that runs within the LIMS to authenticate users for the intranet site, this is a non-Windows authentication.
For example you can use Forms authentication where credentials that are entered in a web form are compared with a user database on the LIMS on the mainframe.  

Book answer
There are several options that could be used to solve this problem. The primary, and
likely easiest-to-implement, option is to create a custom authentication provider that
implements IIdentity and IPrincipal. By overriding the base methods with the custom
code that accesses the database, you can use the same methods to determine authenticity
as you would with a .NET-delivered authentication provider.
 
B. Does the possibility that the client might never change from LIMS authentication affect your solution choice? Why or why not? 

No, it is possible to use LIMS authentication in conjunction with other authentication systems, however you need to synchronise 
the different authentication systems with each other.

Book answer
It should not, as long as you develop your solution using IIdentity and IPrincipal
interfaces rather than the implementation. If the authentication mechanism changes,
managing that in your application could be as simple as switching to a supported
implementation.
     
C. What kind of problems do you anticipate if the LIMS is left on the mainframe?

It could lead to a larger workload on the mainframe if the intranet users are authenticated using the database that runs on the mainframe 
in conjunction with LIMS.  

Book answer
There are many problems that could occur that you should try to predict and resolve.
If the LIM remains on the mainframe, system access can be complicated and will not
fit any of the common providers. You will have to create a custom provider and ensure
that validation occurs with every release.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
99) What type of authentication accepts login credentials that will be checked against the
domain or local server and are sent in a hashed format?

A. Basic authentication
B. Digest authentication
C. Forms authentication
D. Windows authentication

B

Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: Basic authentication is transmitted from the client to the server in
Base64 encoding and is not encrypted.
B. Correct: Digest authentication is a challenge-response–based authentication
method to ensure that user credentials are not sent over the network in clear text.
C. Incorrect: Forms authentication does not require login credentials to be sent in
an encrypted form, and it does not automatically check against the domain and/or
local server.
D. Incorrect: Windows authentication does not send user names and passwords from
the client to the server.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
100) Forms authentication enables you to write code to validate user credentials. After it is
complete, you can register the authentication cookies for use throughout the user’s
visit by using which of the following?

A. FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookie
B. FormsAuthenticationCookie = new FormsAuthenicationCookie();
C. FormsAuthentication.ClearAuthCookie
D. MembershipProvider.User =

A

Correct answer: A
A. Correct: FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookie registers the authentication token in
the cookie for use in future requests.
B. Incorrect: You have created a new FormsAuthenticationCookie, but it has no values,
so it would not be useful in future requests.
C. Incorrect: FormsAuthentication.ClearAuthCookie removes the authentication
token.
D. Incorrect: MembershipProvider.User = does not maintain information between
requests.

scenario in ASP.NET MVC 4? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Authorize attribute
B. RequireHttps attribute
C. WebSecurity.IsAuthenticated
D. AllowAnonymous attribute

D

Correct answers: A, D
A. Correct: AuthorizeAttribute can be put on controllers and actions to require authorization.
B. Incorrect: RequireHttps will ensure that the communication between client and
server is encrypted, but it does not do anything to help ensure an accepted-list
scenario.
C. Incorrect: WebSecurity.IsAuthenticated verifies that a user is authenticated, but it
does not do it in a way that supports an accepted-list scenario.
D. Correct: AllowAnonymous can be put on controllers and actions to enable unauthorized
users access.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
102) What interfaces or classes should be implemented or inherited when creating custom

104)You work for a large manufacturing firm that wants to create a just-in-time (JIT) inventory
management system. The firm purchased an off-the-shelf enterprise system
about five years ago, but the firm’s manufacturing process is so highly customized
that the software does not meet their needs. The project owner said general roles
are not sufficient, and that he wants to define each major item and provide access
to create, read, update, and delete individually. As you evaluate the system, you realize
hundreds of roles must be created, which will make maintenance a challenge.

A. What are some advantages of creating this many roles?  

You can have fine grained (involving great attention to detail) authorization systems.

Book answer
There are several significant advantages to this approach. This is a classic enterprise
approach to determining rights and responsibilities because it gives you control of all
aspects of the use of the system. Companies evolve over time, so the definition of “who
does what” changes as well as personnel and business needs. In the real world, we
often discover situations in which a role named Director needs access to information,
but it is actually an administrative assistant who compiles the information. Should you
assign the Director role to the administrative assistant’s user account as well? In a large
organization, these issues will arise repeatedly. By defining access at this low level,
these kinds of situations can be easily resolved.

B. What can you do to mitigate maintenance challenges? 

You can automate the creation and assignment of Roles to users. In addition you can automate the addition of authorization Roles for each major item.    

Book answer
There are several ways to mitigate maintenance difficulties. The first is to create a subset
of “groups” that have standard sets of functionality. Users are assigned to a group
that gives the users the most appropriate access. If a person’s needs change, the group
assignment can change as well. Users would not see the mechanics of how the group
is actually defined in the system. Another way to mitigate maintenance challenges is
by using templates. Templates let an administrator group a set of roles. This approach
provides many of the flexible features of traditional roles but with the capability to
customize individual access without having to create a new role.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
105) What attribute or code snippet within a controller enables a role named Admin to access actions or code blocks after the check-in code?

A. RoleProvider.GetRolesForUser(“Admin”)
B. [Authorize(Roles=”Admin”)]
C. RoleProvider.IsUserInRole(User.Name)
D. [AuthorizeAttribute(Roles=”Admin”)]

B

Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: RoleProvider.GetRolesForUser(“Admin”) gets the list of roles for the user
that is passed in as a parameter. In this case, it uses a hard-coded value of “Admin.”
B. Correct: The Authorize attribute handles authorization on a controller and/or
action basis by using the Roles= qualifier.
C. Incorrect: RoleProvider.IsUserInRole(User.Name) does a check to see whether the
currently logged in user is within a role that is passed in as a parameter to the
function. In this case, the code will be looking for a role that matches the user’s
name.
D. Incorrect: Although AuthorizeAttribute is the correct class, the proper way to use it
in attribution is through the Authorize keyword.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
106) Which methods help the RoleProvider determine whether a user is assigned a role or set of roles? (Choose all that apply.)

A. GetRoles
B. GetRolesForUser
C. IsUserInRole
D. FindUsersInRole

B (With some additional work you can also use C and D, you need to iterate over the different roles,  )

Correct answers: B, C
A. Incorrect: The GetRoles method provides a list of all roles for an ApplicationName.
B. Correct: GetRolesForUser gets a list of roles for a user.
C. Correct: IsUserInRole returns a Boolean on whether a particular user has a role.
D. Incorrect: FindUsersInRole returns a list of users that have the applicable role.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
107) Why should you create a custom role provider? (Choose all that apply.)

A. To use a data source not regularly supported
B. To use the SimpleRoleProvider
C. To use a database design different than .NET provides
D. To provide a special configuration file entry

A, C

Correct answers: A, C
A. Correct: Because traditional providers work only on SQL Server, accessing a different
data provider such as MySQL would require a custom provider.
B. Incorrect: Using the SimpleRole provider would not require you to create a custom
provider.
C. Correct: Using a different database design would require that you create a custom
provider.
D. Incorrect: Creating a custom provider would require a special configuration file
entry, but that would not be a reason to create the custom provider in the first place.

108) You are working on a new internal site for your employer that will act as a companyspecific
social networking site. Your product owner has requested that this site be
able to be authenticated from your internal Active Directory for your employees,
but you also need to support logins from your customers, using their preferred
authentication mechanisms. They have a mixture of authentication processes that
your application will need to interact with. Answer the following questions for your
manager:

A. What are examples of the kind of claims you would want to get from the client’s
authentication mechanism?

Claims are bits of information the identity provider is willing to share with other applications,
such as name, phone number, or email address. The more claims your application
receives, the more information you know about the user.

Book answer
You should gather information such as name, email address, and employer, at a minimum,
to properly populate a social networking site. Other claim information (such as a
phone number or other personally identifiable information) might also be useful. It is
important to gather a consistent set of information from your clients.

B. What would implementing Windows Azure ACS mean to the work that you have
to do in your application’s code?

It reduces the amount of work that needs to be done, .NET framework has built 
in classes that can handle ACS calls. The Microsoft.Web.WebPages.OAuth namespace 
abstracts out a lot of the work, converting the Authentication using an identity provider   
into just two method calls: VerifyAuthentication and Login.

Book answer
The main consideration is that it enables you to build your application to use a single
source of authentication: the Windows Azure ACS. Your application will not have to
be modified when new clients are brought into the system with their own authentication
points. You simply have to configure ACS to ensure the proper redirection and
authentication.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
109) Windows Azure ACS allows for federated identification from outside agencies such as a Microsoft account or Facebook. Which entity issues the final token that your application will accept for access?

A. The outside agency
B. Your application
C. Your network firewall
D. Windows Azure ACS

D

Correct answer: D
A. Incorrect: The token provided by a Microsoft account or Facebook is read by ACS,
which then creates the token that your application uses.
B. Incorrect: An application does not read the token; it reads the token provided by
ACS.
C. Incorrect: A network firewall does not provide a security token.
D. Correct: ACS reads the token provided by the identity providers and creates a
token that your application understands and accepts.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
110) WIF enables you to create a custom token. To be able to use the token, you must create a custom token handler by inheriting from which of the following classes?

A. SecurityToken
B. SecurityTokenHandler
C. SWTToken
D. Saml2SecurityTokenHandler

B When you create the handler for your token, you need to derive from the SecurityTokenHandler.

Correct answer: B
A. Incorrect: SecurityToken is the .NET Framework class that identifies the token.
B. Correct: SecurityTokenHandler is the appropriate class to override for creating a
custom token handler.
C. Incorrect: SWTToken is a type of common token.
D. Incorrect: Saml2SecurityTokenHandler is a specific handler for a specific type of
token.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

114) Exceptions originating from IIS must display a page with support contact information.
Some page links expire, and users who access these links encounter 404 errors.
You need to implement the requirements for handling IIS errors.
What should you do?

A) Update the customErrors attribute in the web.config file as follows: 
<customErrors mode="On" defaultRedirect="ErrorManager/CustomerErrorView">
	<error statusCode="404" redirect="ErrorManager/Error404" />
</customErrors>

B)Update the customErrors attribute in the app.config file as follows: 
<customErrors mode="Off" defaultRedirect="ErrorManager/CustomerErrorView">
	<error statusCode="404" redirect="ErrorManager/Error404" />
</customErrors>

C)Update the customErrors attribute in the app.config file as follows: 
<customErrors mode="On" defaultRedirect="ErrorManager/CustomerErrorView">
	<error statusCode="401" redirect="ErrorManager/Error401" />
</customErrors>

D)Update the customErrors attribute in the web.config file as follows: 
<customErrors mode="On" defaultRedirect="ErrorManager/CustomerErrorView">
	<error statusCode="403" redirect="ErrorManager/Error403" />
</customErrors>

A

Remark:
From scenario: Some page links expire, and users who access these links encounter 404 errors.
The customErrors element has two attributes that are of interest: mode and
defaultRedirection. There are three values for mode: On, Off, and RemoteOnly. On and Off
specify whether custom errors should be used. RemoteOnly specifies that custom errors
are displayed only to remote users while standard error pages are shown to local users.
RemoteOnly is the default setting. The defaultRedirection attribute gives an overall handler.
If an error occurs that is not handled with a more specific error element, this is the
URL that will be presented to the user.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
115) You updated the web.config file with the HTTP run-time value required to display an alternative version of

118) The web store application is in a load-balanced web farm. You need to configure session storage in the 
web.config file to meet the technical requirements for scalability.
Which SessionState mode should you use? (Each correct answer presents a complete solution. Choose all that apply.)

A. StateServer
B. InProc
C. AutoDetect
D. SqlServer

A and D

In a distributed environment, it is important to remember that that requests can be
distributed among different servers when using a session. There are three modes of session
management available in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS): InProc, StateServer,
and SQLServer. They each have advantages and disadvantages.
You can configure IIS to manage the SessionId either way. InProc mode is the default setting
and means that the web sessions are stored in the web server’s local memory. This option
provides the best performance but is not clusterable and cannot be used in a load-balanced web farm. 
In StateServer mode, session information is stored in memory on a separate server. 
All web farm servers that use the same state server have access to the state information. 
SQLServer mode has the same advantage as StateServer in that the session information is 
shared across multiple servers. It has a performance impact, however, because there 
needs to be a call to a SQLServer and it will add latency to the session access.

121) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC web application in Visual Studio. The application requires several
thousand content files. All content is hosted on the same IIS instance as the application.
You detect performance issues when the application starts.
You need to resolve the performance issues.
What should you do?

A. Implement HTTP caching in the ASP.NET MVC controllers.
B. Combine the content files by using ASP.NET MVC bundling.
C. Install a second IIS instance.
D. Move the content to a Windows Azure CDN.

B 

Bundling reduces the number of concurrent connections needed by the browser to download all the js and css files.
Most browser limit the number of concurrent connections to a website to six.

Bundling is a feature that makes it easy to combine or bundle multiple files into a
single file. You can create CSS, JavaScript and other bundles. Fewer files means fewer HTTP requests
and that can improve first page load performance.

122) You are testing an ASP.NET application.
The test plan requires that tests run against the application's business layer.
You need to use the test project template that meets this requirement.
Which template should you use?

A. Web Test Project
B. Load Test Project
C. Unit Test Project
D. Coded Test Project

C
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
123) You are authoring unit tests.
The unit tests must test code that consumes sealed classes.
You need to create, maintain, and inject dependencies in the unit tests.
Which isolation method should you use?

A. T4 text templates and code generation
B. Stub types
C. Shim types
D. Hard-coded implementation

C

Shim types are one of two technologies that the Microsoft Fakes Framework uses to let you easily isolate
components under test from the environment. Shims divert calls to specific methods to code that you write
as part of your test. Many methods return different results dependent on external conditions, but a shim is
under the control of your test and can return consistent results at every call. This makes your tests much
easier to write.

Fakes provides two different ways to manage dependencies within
your application when performing tests: shims and stubs. A shim is a small piece of code that
intercepts a call to an assembly and has it return an object you created, or mocked. A stub is
code that replaces a working class with a limited subset of a class you mocked up. Shims are
generally used to provide mocks from assemblies outside of your solution, whereas stubs are
used to create mocks of classes within your solution.

127) The application must store a small amount of information that is shared cross all users and does not
change frequently. You need to configure the application to meet the requirements.
Which server-side state management option should you use? 
(Each correct answer presents a complete solution. Choose all that apply.)

A. Microsoft Azure application state
B. SQL Database
C. Profile properties of the Microsoft Azure application
D. Microsoft Azure session state

Correct Answer: B

Explanation:
SQL Database provides a relational database management system for Windows Azure and is based on
SQL Server technology. With a SQL Database instance, you can easily provision and deploy relational
database solutions to the cloud, and take advantage of a distributed data center that provides enterpriseclass
availability, scalability, and security with the benefits of built-in data protection and self-healing.

Incorrect:
Not A: Application State does not exist in Azure.
Not C: Profile properties stores personal, not global, information.
Not D: Session state is not global. Session states handles user information such as cookies, hidden fields,
and query strings are some client-side options to tracking user state

ASP.NET MVC state storage can be:
=> Table Storage (We can also go with this approach but it will need extra cost)
=> Windows Azure Caching (This is the fastest one but it is very costly)
=> SQL Azure

129) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application.
You need to authenticate clients by using NT LAN Manager (NTLM).
Which authentication method should you implement?

A. Basic
B. Windows
C. Forms
D. Kerberos

B

Windows authentication
Windows authentication, as its name implies, manages the process of logging in through
a Windows account. There are two authentication protocols: NTLM and Kerberos. These
protocols are supported only in Microsoft browsers because Windows authentication doesn’t
require the user to provide login credentials; instead, the server retrieves the user’s 
login information from the browser’s credentials cache. Windows authentication, therefore, 
provides for a single sign-on experience for users who have already logged in to the domain, 
such as from their desktop computer. Although there are some limiting factors, such as proxy 
settings, usage is straightforward and easy to implement, especially on an intranet.

130) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application.
The application must allow users to enter HTML in a feedback text box only.
You need to disable request validation.
What should you do?

A. Use the HttpRequest.Unvalidated property to read the unvalidated form value
B. Apply and set the CausesValidation attribute on the controller action to FALSE
C. Apply and set the ValidateInput attribute on the controller action to FALSE
D. Use the HttpRequest.Form property to read the unvalidated form value

Correct Answer: A

In ASP.NET 4.5 and ASP.NET MVC 4, the developer has unvalidated access to the data in the request. 
A new collection property in the HttpRequest class called Unvalidated enables access to all the standard 
request data, including Form, Cookies, and QueryString. The code is as follows:

var s = context.Request.Unvalidated.Form["some_value"];

The HttpRequest.Unvalidated property gets the HTTP request values without triggering request validation.
Request validation checks for HTML markup and script that might indicate a potential cross-site scripting
attack. By default, all values are checked using request validation and if any values contain markup or
script, ASP.NET throws an HttpRequestValidationException exception. Use this method if you anticipate
that the request will contain markup (for example, you are allowing users to post content that contains
markup) and you want to get the raw value of a request.

138) You are designing a distributed banking application that handles multiple customers. A user may log on to
the site to perform activities such as checking balances, performing transactions, and other activities that
must be done securely. The application must store secure information that is specific to an individual user. The data must be
automatically and securely purged when the user logs off. You need to save transient information in a secure data store.
Which data store should you use?

A. NET session state
B. NET profile properties
C. NET application state
D. Shared database

A

ASP.NET session state enables you to store and retrieve values for a user as the user navigates ASP.NET
pages in a Web application. HTTP is a stateless protocol. This means that a Web server treats each HTTP
request for a page as an independent request. The server retains no knowledge of variable values that
were used during previous requests. ASP.NET session state identifies requests from the same browser
during a limited time window as a session, and provides a way to persist variable values for the duration of
that session.

A. Gacutil.exe
B. Al.exe
C. Ildasm.exe
D. Ilasm.exe

B
Use the Assembly Linker (Al.exe) to compile .resources files into satellite assemblies. Al.exe creates an
assembly from the .resources files that you specify. By definition, satellite assemblies can only contain
resources. They cannot contain any executable code.

140) You are preparing for the deployment of an ASP.NET MVC application. You need to generate a deployment
manifest. Which command-line tool should you use?

A. Mage.exe
B. Ngen.exe
C. AL.exe
D. Resgen.exe

A
The Manifest Generation and Editing Tool (Mage.exe) is a command-line tool that supports the creation
and editing of application and deployment manifests.

Not B: The Native Image Generator (Ngen.exe) is a tool that improves the performance of managed
applications. Ngen.exe creates native images
Not C: Al.exe generates a file with an assembly manifest, not a deployment manifest, from one or more
files that are either resource files or Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL) files.
Not D: Resgen.exe, the Resource File Generator, converts text (.txt or .restext) files and XML-based
resource format (.resx) files to common language runtime binary (.resources) files that can be embedded in
a runtime binary executable or compiled into satellite assemblies.

B. Apply and set the CausesClientSideValidation attribute on the text box to FALSE
C. Apply and set the ValidateInput attribute on the text box to FALSE
D. Use the HttpRequest.Form property to read the unvalidated form value

143) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application that uses forms authentication. 
Authentication credentials must be encrypted and secure.
You need to ensure that user credentials are persisted after users log on.
In which two locations can you store the credentials? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

A. In ViewData
B. In TempData
C. In Session
D. In a cookie

Correct Answer: CD

Server sessions and cookies can both be configured to secure and they both persist after the users log on.
A: ViewData's life only lasts during current http request.
B: TempData is a bucket where you can dump data that is only needed for the following request. That is,
anything you put into TempData is discarded after the next request completes.

144) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application that uses forms authentication. The application uses
SQL queries that display customer order data. Logs show there have been several malicious attacks against the servers.
You need to prevent all SQL injection attacks from malicious users against the application.
How should you secure the queries?

A. Check the input against patterns seen in the logs and other records.
B. Escape single quotes and apostrophes on all string-based input parameters.
C. Implement parameterization of all input strings.
D. Filter out prohibited words in the input submitted by the users.

C

SQL Injection Prevention, Defense Option 1: Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries)
The use of prepared statements (aka parameterized queries) is how all developers should first be taught
how to write database queries. They are simple to write, and easier to understand than dynamic queries.
Parameterized queries forcethe developer to first define all the SQL code, and then pass in each parameter
to the query later. This coding style allows the database to distinguish between code and data, regardless
of what user input is supplied.

Prepared statements ensure that anattacker is not able to change the intent of a query, even if SQL
commands are inserted by an attacker.

145) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application that uses forms authentication against a third-party
database. You need to authenticate the users. Which code segment should you use?

A 
public class SAMembershipProvider : SqlMembershipProvider 	
{
...
}

B 
public class SAMembershipProvider : ClientFormsMembershipProvider 	
{
...
}


C 
public class SAMembershipProvider : ProviderBase 	
{
...
}


D 
public class SAMembershipProvider : MembershipProvider 	
{
...
}


D

ASP.NET membership is designed to enable you to easily use a number of different membership providers
for your ASP.NET applications.

There are two primary reasons for creating a custom membership provider.
1) You need to store membership information in a data source that is not supported by the membership
providers included withthe .NET Framework, such as a FoxPro database, an Oracle database, or other
data sources.
2) You need to manage membership information using a database schema that is different from the
database schema used by the providers that ship with the .NET Framework.

To implement a membership provider, you create a class that inherits the MembershipProvider abstract
class from the System.Web.Security namespace.

Not C: Class ProviderBase
The provider model is intended to encapsulate all or part of the functionality of multiple ASP.NET features,
such as membership, profiles, and protected configuration.

146) You are designing an enterprise-level Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) application. User
accounts will migrate from the existing system. The new system must be able to scale to accommodate the
increasing load. You need to ensure that the application can handle large-scale role changes.
Which two approaches can you use for authorization? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

A. Resource-based trusted subsystem model
B. Identity-based approach
C. Role-based approach
D. Resource-based impersonation/delegation model 

BC

Once authorization is available as an autonomous service, the need for impersonation is eliminated.
Instead of assuming the identity of the user, the application uses its own credentials to access services and
resources, but it captures the user's identity and passes it as a parameter (or token) to be used for
authorization when a request is made. This model is referred to as the trusted subsystem model, because
the application acts as a trusted subsystem within the security domain.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
147) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application to be used on the Internet. The environment uses Active
Directory with delegation to access secure resources. Users must be able to log on to the application to 
maintain their personal preferences. You need to use the least amount of development effort to enable users to log on.
What should you do?

A. Enable Forms authentication
B. Enable Windows authentication
C. Generate server SSL certificates and install them in IIS
D. Enable Digest authentication

Correct Answer: B

Requirements for Delegation
Delegation relies on Integrated Windows authentication to access resources. There is no limit on the
number of computers that you can delegate your account -- you must correctly configure each of them. The
Integrated Windows authentication method works only if the following two conditions exist:
You set up your network to use the Kerberos authentication protocol that requires Active Directory.
You set up the computers and accounts on your network as trusted for delegation.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
148) You are developing a controller for an ASP.NET MVC application that manages message board postings.
The security protection built in to ASP.NET is preventing users from saving their HTML.
You need to enable users to edit and save their HTML while maintaining existing security protection
measures. Which code segment should you use?

A
[ValidateInput(false)]
public class MessageBoardController : Controller
{
	public ActionResult SavePosting(MessageBoardPosting mbp)
	{
		SaveMessageBoardPosting(mbp);
		return View("ManagePosting");
	}
}

B
public class MessageBoardController : Controller
{
	[ValidateInput(true)]
	public ActionResult SavePosting(MessageBoardPosting mbp)
	{
		SaveMessageBoardPosting(mbp);
		return View("ManagePosting");
	}
}

C
[ValidateInput(true)]
public class MessageBoardController : Controller
{
	public ActionResult SavePosting(MessageBoardPosting mbp)
	{
		SaveMessageBoardPosting(mbp);
		return View("ManagePosting");
	}
}

D
public class MessageBoardController : Controller
{
	[ValidateInput(false)]
	public ActionResult SavePosting(MessageBoardPosting mbp)
	{
		SaveMessageBoardPosting(mbp);
		return View("ManagePosting");
	}
}

Correct Answer: D

One of the risks of allowing users input is that they might insert potentially dangerous
information. The ValidateInputAttribute gives you control over the content coming back from
a post operation and ensures that there is no potentially dangerous content, such as <$ or
<! items, which could potentially lead to problems. You can select form fields that will not be
validated in the attribute by [ValidateInput(true, Exclude = “ArbitraryField”)] and on a model
property by decorating the model property with the AllowHtml attribute. You can also turn
validation completely off, if desired using [ValidateInput(false)].

149) You are designing an MVC web application. The view must be as simple as possible for designers who do not have a technical background.
You need to combine two existing models to meet the requirement. Which component of the MVC framework should you use?

A. View
B. View Model
C. Controller
D. Model


B, in the Controller you combine the two existing models into a ViewModel that is passed to the View.    
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

150) You are developing an application that uses many small images for various aspects of the interface.
The application responds slowly when additional resources are being accessed.
You need to improve the performance of the application. What should you do?

A. Preload all the images when the client connects to ensure that the images are cached.
B. Combine all the images into a single image and use CSS to create sprites.
C. Host all images on an alternate server and provide a CDN.
D. Convert the images to .png file format and stream all images on a single connection.

B, C hosting the images on a CDN could also improve performance, if CDN server is near enduser. 

An image sprite is a collection of images put into a single image.
A web page with many images can take a long time to load and generates multiple server requests.
Using image sprites will reduce the number of server requests and save bandwidth.
Browsers limit the number of concurrent requests a site can make and HTTP requests require a bit of handshaking.
Thus, sprites are important for the same reasons that minifying and bundling CSS and JavaScript are important.
You can combine many small images into a single larger image - a CSS sprite - using the free ASP.NET
Sprite and Image Optimization Library available from Microsoft.

151) You are designing a localized ASP.NET MVC online shopping application that will be deployed to
customers in the United States, China, France, and Brazil. The application must support multiple cultures
so that content in the appropriate language is available in each area.
You need to ensure that the content can be viewed in several languages.
How should you implement this feature?

A. Use a resource (.resx) file to provide translations.
B. Use Systems.Collections.Generics.Dictionary to store alternative translations.
C. Ensure that all strings are marked internal to avoid conflict with internal literals.
D. Include language-specific content in the assembly manifest and use .NET culture libraries.

Correct Answer: A

A resource file is an XML file that contains the strings that you want to translate into different languages or
paths to images. The resource file contains key/value pairs. Each pair is an individual resource. Key names
are not case sensitive. For example, a resource file might contain a resource with the key Button1 and the
value Submit.
You create a separate resource file for each language (for example, English and French) or for a language
and culture (for example English [U.K.], English [U.S.]). Each localized resource file has the same key/value
pairs; the only difference is that a localized resource file can contain fewer resources than the default
resource file. The built-in language fallback process then handles loading the neutral or default resource.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
152) You need to enable client-side validation for an ASP.NET MVC application.
Which three actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

A. Attach a custom validation attribute to the model properties that the view uses.
B. Reference the jquery, jquery.validate and jquery.validate.unobtrusive script files in the view.
C. Open the web.config file at the project root, and set the values of the ClientValidationEnabled and
UnobtrusiveJavaScriptEnabled keys to True.
D. For each form element, use the Validator.element() method to validate each item.
E. Add data annotations to the model properties that the view uses.

Correct Answer: BCE

C is needed when you use Remote validation as shown below. 

[Required]
[StringLength(6, MinimumLength = 3)]
[Remote("IsUserAvailable", "Validation")]
[RegularExpression(@"(\S)+", ErrorMessage = "White space is not allowed.")]
[Editable(true)]
public string UserName { get; set; }

You also need to make some configuration changes so the server knows to allow remote
validation. Without proper configuration, the server does not pick up the Remote attribute
and allow communications back to the server. The following code snippet shows the additions
to make in the Web.config file to allow the use of the Remote attribute:
<appSettings>
<add key="ClientValidationEnabled" value="true" />
<add key="UnobtrusiveJavaScriptEnabled" value="true" />
</appSettings>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
153)You are developing an application that uses many small images.
When the images load, the application runs slowly.
You need to improve the performance of the application.
What should you do?

A. Preload all the images when the application starts to ensure that the images are cached.
B. Convert the images to ICO file format and stream all images on a single connection.
C. Host all images on a Microsoft Azure web role with multiple instances.
D. Combine all the images into a single image and use CSS to create sprites.

D

Because browsers limit how many concurrent HTTP requests they make to a website, a web page with
many small icon images can result in a longer load time. You can combine many small images into a single
larger image - a CSS sprite - using the free ASP.NET Sprite and Image Optimization Library available from
Microsoft.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
154)You are developing an ASP.NET application that allows users to download Microsoft Azure log files. You
need to improve the performance of the application. What should you do?

A. Minify the content files.
B. Enable compression in IIS.
C. Bundle the content files into a single .tar file.
D. Host the image, JavaScript, and CSS files on a different server.

Answer C

Bundling is a new feature in ASP.NET 4.5 that makes it easy to combine or bundle multiple files into a single file. 
You can create CSS, JavaScript and other bundles. Fewer files means fewer HTTP requests and that can improve first page load performance.
Answer C is correct. if logging info happens in windows systems we can select B, but in the question it is Azure logs so answer should be C.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
155) You are building an ASP.NET web application.
You must test the web application in multiple browsers at the same time.
You need to ensure that the application can use the Browser Link feature.
Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

A. In the web.config file, set the value of the debug attribute to False.
B. In the web.config file, set the value of the debug attribute to True.
C. Enable Browser link.
D. Use an external editor for webpages.
E. Enable source control server support.

Correct Answer: BC

Debugging must be enabled in the web.config file.
To enable Browser Link, set debug=true in the <compilation> element in the project’s Web.config file.

Browser Link is a Visual Studio feature. It creates a communication channel between the development environment and one or more web browsers. 
You can use Browser Link to refresh your web app in several browsers at once, which is useful for cross-browser testing.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/using-browserlink?view=aspnetcore-3.1

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
156) You deploy an ASP.NET MVC Web application to Internet Information Services (IIS). The application has a
secure area that provides access to custom reports.
You must develop custom business logic to support the reports. The custom business logic has the
following requirements:

It must run each time that a report is requested.
It must not run for other IIS requests.
It must be mapped to the request extension of the report.
It must be written by using a managed language that is supported by the .NET framework.

You must be able to quickly modify and deploy updates to the business logic.
You need to develop the custom business logic.
What should you do?

A. Update the report logic to include the custom business logic. Use WebDAV to publish the reports to the server.
B. Develop a new HTTP module that includes the custom business logic. Deploy the HTTP module to IIS.
C. Develop a new HTTP handler that includes the custom business logic. Deploy the HTTP handler to IIS.
D. Develop a new ISAPI filter that includes the custom business logic. Deploy the ISAPI filter to IIS.

Correct Answer: C

An ASP.NET HTTP handler is the process that runs in response to a request that is made to an ASP.NET
Web application. ASP.NET maps HTTP requests to HTTP handlers based on a file name extension.

Not B: HTTP modules differ from HTTP handlers. An HTTP handler returns a response to a request that is
identified by a file name extension or family of file name extensions. In contrast, an HTTP module is
invoked for all requests and responses. It subscribes to event notifications in the request pipeline and lets
you run code in registered event handlers.

157)You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application to be used on the Internet. The environment does not
use Active Directory. Users must be able to log on to the application to maintain their personal preferences.
You need to use the least amount of development effort to enable users to log on. What should you do?

A. Enable Digest authentication.
B. Enable Windows authentication.
C. Enable Forms authentication.
D. Generate server SSL certificates and install them in IIS.

C

Many Web applications require a way to restrict access to some resources (such as specific pages) so that
those resources are accessible only to authenticated users. The default Web application project template
for ASP.NET MVC provides a controller, data models, and views that you can use to add ASP.NET forms
authentication to your application. The built-in functionality lets users register, log on and off, and change
their password. For many applications, this functionality provides a sufficient level of user authentication.

Not B: Windows authentication would require an Active Directory.
Windows authentication method works only if the following two conditions exist:
You set up your network to use the Kerberos authentication protocol that requires Active Directory.
You set up the computers and accounts on your network as trusted for delegation.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
158) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application that will run in a shared environment.
The application requests the user's password, and then uses the password to sign data.
You need to minimize the potential for the password to be discovered by other processes that run in the
shared environment. What should you do?

A. Add the SecuritySafeCriticalAttribute attribute to the methods which process the password.
B. Store the password in a SecureString instance.
C. Encrypt the password on the web page, and decrypt the password in the MVC application.
D. Run the code that processes the password in its own AppDomain.

Correct Answer: D

Application domains provide a unit of isolation for the common language runtime. They are created and run
inside a process. Application domains are usually created by a runtime host, which is an application
responsible for loading the runtime into a process and executing user code within an application domain.
The runtime host creates a process and a default application domain, and runs managed code inside it.
Runtime hosts include ASP.NET, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and the Windows shell.
For most applications, you do not need to create your own application domain; the runtime host creates any
necessary application domains for you. However, you can create and configure additional application
domains if your application needs to isolate code or to use and unload DLLs.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
159)You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application. The application uses a set of custom exceptions to log
errors that occur during the execution of an action. You need to develop a class that implements logging.
Which interface should you implement?

A. IExceptionFilter
B. IActionFilter
C. IClientValidatable
D. IResultFilter

A

Exception filters are used to apply global policies to unhandled exceptions in the MVC app.
Exception Filters implement either the IExceptionFilter or IAsyncExceptionFilter interface.
Exception filters handle unhandled exceptions, including those that occur during controller creation and
model binding. They are only called when an exception occurs in the pipeline.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
160) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application. Devices that use many different browsers will use the
application. You have the following requirements:

Content must display correctly when a device is in landscape or portrait orientation.
Content must not scale when the device orientation changes.
Content must be displayed by using the maximum available screen space.
The application must render properly in Internet Explorer 8 or later versions.
You need to configure the application.
Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

A. Use JavaScript to evaluate the window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight properties.
B. Set the value of the width property for the viewport meta tag to device-width.
C. Use CSS to target the HTML element on each page. Set the values of the width and height properties to 100%.
D. Use CSS media queries to target screen size, device orientation, and other browser capabilities.

B D

If you want the viewport width to match the device’s physical pixels, you can specify the following:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
For this to work correctly, you must not explicitly force elements to exceed that width (e.g., using a width
attribute or CSS property), otherwise the browser will be forced to use a larger viewport regardless.
D: Media queries in CSS3 extend the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they
look at the capability of the device.
Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:
width and height of the viewport
width and height of the device
orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
resolution
Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to tablets, iPhone, and Androids.

161) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application. The application includes the following method. 

private string GenerateMessage(string userAgent)
{
	
	string msg = "Browser OK.";
	if(userAgent.ToLower().Contains("bot"))
	{
		msg = "Web crawlers prohibited".
	}
	
	return msg;
}

The application calls the GenerateMessage method before displaying each page.
The GenerateMessage method throws NullReferenceException exceptions.
You need to use Code Contracts to prevent the exceptions.
Which code segment should you insert at line 03?

A. Contract.Assume(userAgent !=null);
B. Contract.Requires(userAgent !=null);
C. Contract.Ensures(userAgent !=null);
D. Contract.Invariant(userAgent !=null);

B

There's "Microsoft Code Contracts" where you use syntax like Contract.Requires(obj != null) which gives
you runtime and compile checking. Contract.Requires specifies a precondition contract for an enclosing
method or property.

A: Contract.Assume instructs code analysis tools to assume that the specified condition is true, even if it
cannot be statically proven to always be true.
C: Contract.Ensures specifies a postcondition contract for the enclosing method or property.
D: Contract.Invariant specifies an invariant contract for the enclosing method or property, and displays a
message if the condition for the contract fails.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
162) You are developing an ASP.NET application. You need to minimize the amount of data in all HTTP responses.
What should you do?

A. Minify the content files.
B. Enable compression in IIS.
C. Host the image, JavaScript, and CSS files on Microsoft Azure Storage.
D. Bundle the content files.

Correct Answer: B

Network bandwidth is a limited resource. Reducing the size of the response usually increases the
responsiveness of an app, often dramatically. One way to reduce payload sizes is to compress an app's
responses. Use server-based response compression technologies in IIS, Apache, or Nginx.

Note minification can also lead to less data transfered from server to client. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
163) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application.
You need to authenticate clients by using an ASP.NET membership database.
Which authentication method should you implement?

A. Kerberos
B. Windows
C. Forms
D. Basic

Correct Answer: C

To use authentication through a membership database, you must first configure it for your site. The
following are the basic steps you follow in order to configure membership:
1. Specify membership options as part of your Web site configuration.
2. Configure your application to use forms authentication
3. Define user accounts for membership.

164) You are developing an ASP.NET Core MVC web application. The landing page of the application contains
over 100 small JPEG images, including many images that have embedded text.
Mobile device users report performance issues when loading the page. You debug the application and
determine that the number of HTTP requests is causing the issue.
You need to improve the performance of the landing page.
Solution: Convert all images to JPEG with a high compression ratio.
Does the solution meet the goal?

A. Yes
B. No

B

Compressing the images does not reduce the number of HTTP requests.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
165) You are designing a distributed application. The application must store a small amount of information that is 
shared across all users and does not change frequently. You need to configure the application to meet the requirements.
Which server-side state management options will achieve the goal? Each correct answer presents a complete solution. 
Choose all that apply.

A. Database support
B. Profile properties
C. Session state
D. Application state

Correct Answer: AD

Explanation/Reference:
Explanation:
A: SQL Database provides a relational database management system for Windows Azure and is based on
SQL Server technology. With a SQL Database instance, you can easily provision and deploy relational
database solutions to the cloud, and take advantage of a distributed data center that provides enterprise class
availability, scalability, and security with the benefits of built-in data protection and self-healing.

D: Application state is a data repository available to all classes in an ASP.NET application. Application state
is stored in memory on the server and is faster than storing and retrieving information in a database. Unlike
session state, which is specific to a single user session, application state applies to all users and sessions.
Therefore, application state is a useful place to store small amounts of often-used data that does not
change from one user to another.

Incorrect Answers:
B: Profile properties stores personal, not global, information.
C: Session state is not global. Session states handles user information such as cookies, hidden fields, and
query strings are some client-side options to tracking user state

166) You develop an ASP.NET web application that is self-hosted using Open Web Interface for .NET (OWIN) in
a Microsoft Azure Worker role. The web application throws exceptions.
You need to resolve the exceptions.

Solution: Use standard HttpModule and HttpHandler types.

Does the solution meet the goal?
A. Yes
B. No

Correct Answer: B

Note: Open Web Interface for .NET (OWIN) defines an abstraction between .NET web servers and web
applications. OWIN decouples the web application from the server, which makes OWIN ideal for selfhosting
a web application in your own process, outside of IIS–for example, inside an Azure worker role.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
167) You define a startup task in the ServiceDefinition.csdef file. The task consists of a batch file that runs a
Windows PowerShell script. The script places configuration files in local storage for use in a worker role.
The worker role needs this information before starting. The worker role does not start after the startup task runs.
You need to ensure that the worker role starts. What should you do?

A. Use environment variables based on members of the RoleEnvironment class instead of static environment variables.
B. Configure the task to use the directory specified by the TEMP environment variable.
C. Ensure the task completes with an errorlevel of 0.
D. Change the task from simple to foreground.

C

Startup tasks must end with an errorlevel (or exit code) of zero for the startup process to complete. If a
startup task ends with a non-zero errorlevel, the role will not start.
Note: Startup tasks are actions that are taken before your roles begin and are defined in the
ServiceDefinition.csdef file by using the Task element within the Startup element. Frequently startup tasks
are batch files, but they can also be console applications, or batch files that start PowerShell scripts.

180)You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application. The application must allow users to enter 
JavaScript in a feedback text box only. You need to disable request validation.
What should you do?

A. Apply and set the CausesClientSideValidation attribute on the text box to FALSE.
B. Apply and set the ValidateInput attribute on the text box to FALSE.
C. Use the HttpRequest.Unvalidated property to read the unvalidated form value.
D. Use the HttpRequest.Form property to read the unvalidated form value.

C

The HttpRequest.Unvalidated property gets the HTTP request values without triggering request
validation. Request validation checks for HTML markup and script that might indicate a potential cross-site scripting
attack. By default, all values are checked using request validation and if any values contain markup or script, ASP.NET throws an
HttpRequestValidationException exception. Use this method if you anticipate that the
request will contain markup (for example, you are allowing users to post content that contains markup)
and you want to get the raw value of a request.

You can configure the application to use this form of deferred validation by setting the requestValidationMode 
attribute to 4.5 in the httpRuntime element within the Web.config file, as follows:

<httpRuntime requestValidationMode="4.5" ... />
var s = context.Request.Unvalidated.Form["some_value"];

Furthermore, you can skip validation of certain fields in an actionmethod by decorating the action with
the ValidateInput attribute [ValidateInput(true, Exclude = “ArbitraryField”)] and on a model
property by decorating the model property with the AllowHtml attribute. You can also turn
validation completely off using [ValidateInput(false)], if desired.

[ValidateInput(false)]
[HttpPost]
public ActionResult AddArticle(BlogModel blog)

183) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application to be used on the Internet. The environment uses
Active Directory with delegation to access secure resources.
Users must be able to log on to the application to maintain their personal preferences.
You need to use the least amount of development effort to enable users to log on.
What should you do?

A. Enable Forms authentication
B. Enable Windows authentication
C. Generate server SSL certificates and install them in IIS
D. Enable Digest authentication

Correct Answer: B

Requirements for Delegation
Delegation relies on Integrated Windows authentication to access resources. There is no limit on the
number of computers that you can delegate your account to, you must correctly configure each of them. 
The Integrated Windows authentication method works only if the following two conditions exist:
=> You set up your network to use the Kerberos authentication protocol that requires Active Directory.
=> You set up the computers and accounts on your network as trusted for delegation.

184)You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application that uses forms authentication to verify that the user
is logged in. Authentication credentials must be encrypted and secure so no user identity is exposed.
You need to ensure that user credentials are persisted after users log on. Where should you store the 
credentials? (Each correct answer presents a complete solution. Choose all that apply.)

A. In Session on the server
B. In a cookie stored in the browser
C. In ViewData in the application
D. In TempData on the server

Correct Answer: AB

Server sessions and cookies can both be configured to secure and they both persist after the users log on.

Incorrect:
Not C: ViewData's life only lasts during current http request. Not D: TempData is a bucket where you
can dump data that is only needed for the following request.
That is, anything you put into TempData is discarded after the next request completes.

188) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application in Visual Studio 2012. The application processes data for a bakery and contains a controller named
BagelController.es that has several actions. The GetBagel action is defined in the following code segment.

public IActionResult GetBagel(string bagelName)
{
	...
}

The GetBagel action is the only action that should be accessed via a URL pattern. Routes to the other actions in the controller must be suppressed.
The default route must map to HomeController and the Index action. You need to build the routes.
Which three code segments should you use in sequence? (To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them
in the correct order.)

Segment A:
routes.MapRoute(
	name: "Bagels",
	url: "Bagel/GetBagel/{bagelName}",
	defaults: new { controller = "Bagel", action = "GetBagel"}
);

Segment B:

189) You are developing an application that uses many small images. When the images load, the application runs slowly.
You need to improve the performance of the application. What should you do?

A. Preload all the images when the application starts to ensure that the images are cached.
B. Convert the images to ICO file format and stream all images on a single connection.
C. Host all images on a Microsoft Azure web role with multiple instances.
D. Combine all the images into a single image and use CSS to create sprites.

Answer: D

Because browsers limit how many concurrent HTTP requests they make to a website, a web page with many small icon images can result in a longer load time.
You can combine many small images into a single larger image - a CSS sprite - using the free ASP.NET Sprite and Image Optimization Library available from
Microsoft.

192) You are developing an ASP.NET Core MVC web application. You write a Gulp task to automatically minify 
and upload JavaScript CSS, and image files to Microsoft Azure CDN. You need to ensure that the minification 
and upload tasks run automatically after every build in Microsoft Visual Studio Professional.
Which tool should you use?

A. Visual Studio Build Continuous Delivery tool
B. Bower Package manager
C. Azure Publish Dialog\\'s Connected Services section
D. Visual Studio Batch Build dialog
E. Task Runner Explorer After Build binding

Correct Answer: E

In a typical modern web app, the build process might:
=> Bundle and minify JavaScript, CSS, fonts, and image files.
=> Run tools to call the bundling and minification tasks before each build.
=> Compile LESS or SASS files to CSS.
=> Compile CoffeeScript or TypeScript files to JavaScript.

A task runner is a tool which automates these routine development tasks and more. 
Visual Studio provides built-in support for two popular JavaScript-based task runners: Gulp and Grunt.
Gulp is a JavaScript-based streaming build toolkit for client-side code. It's commonly used to stream 
client-side files through a series of processes when a specific event is triggered in a build environment. 
For instance, Gulp can be used to automate bundling and minification or the cleansing of a development environment before a new build.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/using-grunt?view=aspnetcore-2.1
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2016/01/06/task-runners-in-visual-studio-2015/


When Gulp is used to optimize client-side files for staging and production, the processed files are saved to a local staging and production location. 
The _Layout.cshtml file uses the environment tag helper to provide two different versions of CSS files. One version of CSS files is for development 
and the other version is optimized for both staging and production.

<environment names="Development">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/lib/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="~/css/site.css" />
</environment>
<environment names="Staging,Production">

193) You are developing an ASP.NET Core MVC web application. The application must be exposed to 
external users over ports 80 and 443 and must meet the following requirements:

• Handle more than 1024 simultaneous connections.
• Support Windows authentication.
• Support HTTP/2 over TLS.
• Include response caching.
• Protect against denial-of-service attacks.

You need to deploy the application to an on-premises web server. 
Solution: You deploy the application to a standalone Kestrel server. Does the solution meet the goal?

A. Yes
B. No

Answer: B

=> Windows Authentication does not exist on Kestrel as it’s cross platform.

Kestrel server is not a fully-featured web server, but that’s precisely why it’s fast. Because it is so 
lightweight the Kestrel server does not have every advanced features of webservers like IIS, Nginx, Apache, 
etc has, Kestrel does not allow you to do SSL termination, URL rewrites, or GZip compression.
Since Kestrel is not a fully-featured web server, you should run it behind IIS or NGINX. It was designed 
to make ASP.NET as fast as possible but is limited in its ability to manage security and serve static files. 

As it is mentioned above, Kestrel is a very light webserver and it does not support all features of a full-fledged webserver 
like IIS provide. So, if your application is external facing public website then the application should be deployed behind 
a full-fledged webserver like IIS or Nginx or Apache for increased security and to get feature rich support. These webservers 
act as proxy (commonly called reverse proxy in this scenario) and forward the request to Kestrel for request processing.
Microsoft recommends using a reverse proxy, whether that be IIS, NGINX or Apache, to sit infront of Kestrel and be your 
public facing web server/proxy.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
194) You plan to deploy an ASP.NET Core MVC web application to an internal server cluster that runs Kestrel on Linux. 
The server cluster hosts many other web applications. All applications are behind an Nginx load balancer.
You need to ensure that the application meets the following requirements:

• Secure against man-in-the-middle attacks.
• Allow Open ID Connect authentication.
• Cache responses using HTTP caching.

Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

A. Enable the proxy_cache_bypass module.
B. Configure ASP.NET Core to use forwarded headers.
C. Bind Kestrel to port 0.
D. Terminate Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) in Kestrel.

Answer: B and C

B: Because requests are forwarded by reverse proxy, we must use the Forwarded Headers Middleware
from the Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides package. The middleware updates the Request.Scheme,
using the X-Forwarded-Proto header, so that redirect URIs and other security policies work correctly.
C: When the port number 0 is specified, Kestrel dynamically binds to an available port. When the app is run,
the console window output indicates the dynamic port where the app can be reached.

References:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/linux-nginx?view=aspnetcore-2.2
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel?view=aspnetcore-2.2

Notes:
Because requests are forwarded by reverse proxy, use the Forwarded Headers Middleware from the Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides package. 
The middleware updates the Request.Scheme, using the X-Forwarded-Proto header, so that redirect URIs and other security policies work correctly.
Any component that depends on the scheme, such as authentication, link generation, redirects, and geolocation, must be placed after invoking the 
Forwarded Headers Middleware. As a general rule, Forwarded Headers Middleware should run before other middleware except diagnostics and error 
handling middleware. This ordering ensures that the middleware relying on forwarded headers information can consume the header values for processing.

Invoke the UseForwardedHeaders method at the top of Startup.Configure before calling other middleware. Configure the middleware to forward the 
X-Forwarded-For and X-Forwarded-Proto headers:

A Nginx reverse proxy server can offload work such as serving static content, caching requests, compressing requests, 
and HTTPS termination from the HTTP server.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
195) You are developing an ASP.NET Core web application. The application includes a secure area only
accessible to authenticated users.

The application must:
• Reside on the same server as the reverse proxy.
• Use a reverse proxy for caching and serving static content.
• Use basic authentication for the secure area.
• Use the HTTPS protocol for the secure area.
• Use the HTTPS protocol for all non-secure content.

You need to deploy the application. Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

A. Use the RewriteMiddleware from Microsoft.AspNetCore.Rewrite.
B. Use the ForwardedHeaders middleware from Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides.
C. Use Http.sys as the web server for the application and Apache on Linux as the reverse proxy.
D. Use Kestrel as the web server for the application and Nginx on Linux as the reverse proxy.

Correct Answer: B and D (Similar to question 194)     
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer?view=aspnetcore-2.1
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/url-rewriting?view=aspnetcore-2.1
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel?view=aspnetcore-2.1

A could also be correct because a reverse proxy is used for caching and serving static content.
RewriteMiddleware from Microsoft.AspNetCore.Rewrite is explained here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/url-rewriting?view=aspnetcore-3.1

Note: HTTP.sys is a web server for ASP.NET Core that only runs on Windows. Hence it cannot reside on the same server as the reverse proxy,
since the reverse proxy is a Linux server that runs Apache webserver.

199) You develop an ASP.NET MVC application. The application has several Razor views.
The application must execute different server-side code for desktop and mobile devices.
You need to choose an approach to support mobile devices. Which two approaches can you use? 
Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

A. Use different controllers and view for both desktop and mobile browsers, but render the views using
Bootstrap framework.
B. Create separate areas for desktop and mobile browsers, implementing independent controllers and
views for each.
C. Use the same controllers for both desktop and mobile browsers, but render different views depending
on the device type.
D. Use different controllers and views for both desktop and mobile browsers, but render the views with the
same Razor layout depending on the device type.

B and D ("Different server side code" is a key point here.)

You can manage the difference in display (Mobile or Desktop) through CSS/HTML5 such as Bootstrap framework (css).
Using multiple views enables you to customize the UI for different application users, but at a cost of more 
pages to maintain. Adding a field to a form requires changes to multiple files. On the other hand, CSS queries 
enable you to make design decisions based on screen size.

JavaScript frameworks such as React and JQuery enables you to create a UI that works with mobile clients, 
even if the client doesn’t support certain features. The framework will gracefully degrade the feature so 
that although there might be some loss of functionality in older or legacy hardware, all functionality should 
not be lost. Finally, this is not an either/or decision. You can create both mobile and default views, 
and customize the mobile views with CSS- or jQuery Mobile-supported functionality.

If targeting smaller screens, you should create a mobile-friendly master page as well as mobile-friendly layouts and designs. 
To create a mobile-friendly layout, copy the master layout file (_Layout.cshtml) and rename it as _Layout.Mobile.cshtml. 
To create a mobile-specific view, add the .Mobile views.

How ASP.NET MVC applications can present mobile-specific pages Since the Model-View-Controller pattern decouples application 
logic (in controllers) from presentation logic (in views), you can choose from any of the following approaches to handling 
mobile support in server-side code:

1. Create separate areas for desktop and mobile browsers, implementing independent controllers and
views for each. This option works best if you're displaying very different screens, containing different
information and leading the user through different workflows optimized for their device type. It may mean
some repetition of code, but you can minimize that by factoring out common logic into an underlying
layer or service.

2. Use the same controllers for both desktop and mobile browsers, but render different views depending
on the device type. This option works best if you're displaying roughly the same data and providing the
same workflows for end users, but want to render very different HTML markup to suit the device being
used.

3. Use the same controllers and views for both desktop and mobile browsers, but render the views with
different Razor layouts depending on the device type. This option works best if you're displaying identical
data on all devices, but simply want to supply different CSS stylesheets or change a few top-level HTML
elements for mobiles.

201) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application that provides instant messaging capabilities to customers. 

You have the following requirements: 
Messages must be able to be sent and received simultaneously. Latency and unnecessary header data must be eliminated.
The application must comply with HTML5 standards. You need to design the application to meet the requirements. 
What should you do?

A. Configure polling from the browser.
B. Implement long-running HTTP requests.
C. Implement WebSockets protocol on the client and the server.
D. Instantiate a MessageChannel object on the client.

Correct Answer: C

Web Sockets API can be used to communicate between code loaded in the browser and the server. 
Since this question is mentioning the requirement of low latency and "full-duplex" 
in a client-server communication, so I would use a web socket.

202) You are maintaining an ASP.NET MVC application that runs on Azure. Remote debugging is enabled for
this role, but the input endpoints for remote debugging have been removed for security reasons. You do not
have permission to view the Azure Portal for this deployment. You can log on by using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
You must attach the input endpoints to enable remote debugging. Which file should you modify?

A. C:\Config\<GUID>.ccf
B. E:\entrypoint.txt
C. E:\ <GUID>.csman
D. C:\Config\<DeploymentID>.WebRole.<index>.xml

Correct Answer: D

This is the main configuration information for your role. If you update your service configuration (either updating the 
config via the management portal or doing an in-place upgrade) there will be multiple copies of the XML file, where the 
<index> is a counter incremented by one for each new config version. You can find the following information in this file:
=> Deployment Name
=> Service Name
=> Certificates
=> Host process
=> cscfg settings and values
=> LocalStorage folders
=> InputEndpoints, InternalEndpoints and port mappings

After you are logged-in using RDP, you can review IIS logs, review Windows event logs, and perform other tasks as needed.

203) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application that will be deployed on local Internet Information
Services (IIS) servers and on an Azure Web Role. You must log events for the application when it is deployed 
locally and on Azure. You must not deploy additional services. You need to implement a logging solution.
Which two technologies can you use? 

A. event log
B. trace
C. console
D. named pipe

Correct Answer: AB
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
204) You are designing an ASP.NET Core MVC application that handles multiple customers. A user may log on to the site to 
perform activities such as checking balances, performing transactions, and other activities that must be done securely. 
The application must store secure information that is specific to an individual user. The data must be automatically and 
securely purged when the user logs off. You need to save transient information in a secure data store. 
Which data store should you use?

A. ASP.NET session state 
B. ASP.NET profile properties 
C. shared database 
D. ASP.NET application state

Answer: A

ASP.NET session state enables you to store and retrieve values for a user as the user navigates ASP.NET pages in a Web application. 
HTTP is a stateless protocol. This means that a Web server treats each HTTP request for a page as an independent request. 
The server retains no knowledge of variable values that were used during previous requests. ASP.NET session state identifies 
requests from the same browser during a limited time window as a session, and provides a way to persist variable values for the duration of that session.

205) You need to ensure that developers can connect to a Windows Azure role by using RDP.
What should you do?

A. Export a certificate without a private key. Upload the .cer file to the Management Certificates section on the Azure Management Portal.
B. Export a certificate with a private key. Upload the .pfxfile to the Management Certificates section on the Azure Management Portal.
C. Export a certificate without a private key. Upload the .cer file to the Certificates section under the TranscodeWorkerRole hosted service on the Azure Management Portal.
D. Export a certificate with a private key. Upload the .pfx file to the Certificates section under the TranscodeWorkerRole hosted service on the Azure Management Portal.

D

Microsoft Azure uses certificates in three ways:
1) Management certificates – Stored at the subscription level, these certificates are used to enable the use of the SDK tools, the Windows Azure Tools for Microsoft
Visual Studio, or the Service Management REST API Reference. These certificates are independent of any cloud service or deployment.
2) Service certificates – Stored at the cloud service level, these certificates are used by your deployed services.
3) SSH Keys – Stored on the Linux virtual machine, SSH keys are used to authenticate remote connections to the virtual machine.

Note:
The certificates that you need for a remote desktop connection are different from the certificates that you use for other Azure operations. The remote access
certificate must have a private key.

206) You develop an ASP.NET web application that is self-hosted using Open Web Interface for .NET (OWIN) in a Microsoft Azure Worker role. 
The web application throws exceptions. You need to resolve the exceptions. Solution: Reference System.Web.dll to run in a custom host.

Does the solution meet the goal?

A. Yes 
B. No

Answer: B

Traditional ASP.NET (up to MVC 5) is tightly coupled to IIS through System.Web.dll. ASP.NET Core provides a separation between 
the web server and your web application. This allows web applications to be portable between different web servers and also 
allows web servers to be self-hosted, which means you can start a web server in your own process, as opposed to a process 
that is owned by dedicated web server software such as IIS.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reliable-services-communication-aspnetcore

207) You are developing an ASP.NET Core MVC web application. The application must be exposed to external users over ports 80 and 443 and must meet the following requirements:
- Handle more than 1024 simultaneous connections
- Support Windows authentication
- Support HTTP/2 over TLS
- Include response caching
- Protect against denial-of-service attacks

You need to deploy the application to an on-premises web server. Solution: You deploy the application to HTTP.sys.
Does the solution meet the goal?

A. Yes 
B. No

Answer: A

HTTP.sys is mature technology that protects against many types of attacks and provides the robustness, security, and scalability of a 
full-featured web server. IIS itself runs as an HTTP listener on top of HTTP.sys.

the same Razor layout depending on the device type.
B. Use the same controllers for both desktop and mobile browsers, but render different views depending
on the device type.
C. Use different controllers and views for both desktop and mobile browsers, but render the views using
the Bootstrap framework.
D. Create separate areas for desktop and mobile browsers implementing independent controllers and
views for each.

212) You develop a new ASP.NET MVC application. You use local storage to maintain state.
The localStorage object’s setItem method is failing to store a value. Which two scenarios 
will cause the failure? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

A. The user has disabled local storage in the browser.
B. The value being stored is a JavaScript array.
C. The newValue property was used prior to calling the setItem method.
D. The value being stored exceeds 10MB in size.

Correct Answer: AD

Key and value must be strings. If it were any other type, like a number, or an object, it gets converted to string automatically.
var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"]; //Array
localStorage.setItem("cars", cars);
var items = localStorage.getItem("cars"); //Retrieved as a string

Creating a new key/value pair if none existed for key previously.
Setting could fail if, e.g., the user has disabled storage for the site, or if the quota has been exceeded.

214) You are developing a collaborative text editor. Multiple users may simultaneously edit the same document
from within the application. You need to ensure that users can see edits from all users as soon as they are made.
Solution: Implement the application by using ASP.NET MVC. Implement the document editor as a SignaIR
hub that brokers changes across client browser instances.

Does the solution meet the goal?

A. Yes
B. No

Correct Answer: A

ASP.NET Core SignalR is a library that simplifies adding real-time web functionality to apps. It uses WebSockets whenever possible.
For most applications, we recommend SignalR over raw WebSockets. SignalR provides transport fallback for environments where WebSockets 
is not available. It also provides a simple remote procedure call app model. And in most scenarios, SignalR has no significant performance 
disadvantage compared to using raw WebSockets.

217) You are developing the landing page for an ASP.NET Core MVC web application that will be used to host
blogs. You are implementing a View component to show text links for common application operations.
Users must be able to customize the HTML for landing pages. You need to ensure that the links for common 
operations reflect the desired layout of the application when links are embedded into customized views.
Which CSS measurement unit should you use for the links?

A. vh
B. em
C. rem
D. px

Correct Answer: B

Pixel is a static measurement, while percent and EM are relative measurements. The size of an EM or percent depends on its parent. 
If the text size of body is 16 pixels, then 150% or 1.5 EM will be 24 pixels (1.5 * 16).
REM is the same as em except it’s always calculated from the html font size. 

The em and rem units are practical in creating perfectly scalable layout!
vh is relative to 1% of the height of the viewport.
Viewport = the browser window size. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1 vw = 0.5cm.

218) You develop an ASP.NET web application that is self-hosted using Open Web Interface for .NET (OWIN) in
a Microsoft Azure Worker role. The web application throws exceptions. You need to resolve the exceptions.
Solution: Change the application startup code to debug the OWIN pipeline.

Does the solution meet the goal?

A. Yes
B. No

Correct Answer: B

We need to install the Microsoft.Owin.Diagnostics package before we change the startup code.
The Microsoft.Owin.Diagnostics package contains middleware that catches unhandled exceptions and
displays an HTML page with error details.

What should you use?

A. a PackageReference node
B. the packages.config file
C. the .nupkg folder name
D. the project.json file

Correct Answer: A

With PackageReference, you can also use MSBuild conditions to choose package references per target framework, or other groupings. 
It also allows for fine-grained control over dependencies and content flow.

220) You are developing an Azure worker role. You enable crash dump collection for the role.
When the role starts, an external application stops responding. You need to download the crash dump 
to determine why the application stops responding. From which two locations can you download the crash dump? 

A. Azure Blob storage
B. The temp folder on the virtual machine that is running the role instance
C. Azure file storage
D. The DiagnosticStore local resource folder on the virtual machine that is running the role instance

Correct Answer: AD

The method public static void EnableCollection( bool enableFullDumps ) {}
enables collection of mini crash dumps or full crash dumps for a role instance.
If enableFullDumps is true, collects full crash dumps. If false, collects mini crash dumps.

When you enable collection of crash dumps, the resulting data is written to the CrashDumps directory in the
DiagnosticStore local resource that is automatically configured for your role. When crash dump data is transferred 
to persistent storage, it is stored to the wad-crash-dumps Blob container.
https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.windowsazure.diagnostics.crashdumps.enablecollection.aspx
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-services/cloud-services-dotnet-diagnostics

Note:
This API is not supported in Azure SDK versions 2.5 and higher. Instead, use the diagnostics.wadcfg XML configuration file. 
For more information, see Collect Logging Data by Using Azure Diagnostics.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-services/cloud-services-dotnet-diagnostics

Note: 
You can also use C. Azure file storage to store crash dumps as can be read in link below.  
"Resource logs, metrics, and crash dumps are just three examples of data that can be written to a file share and processed or analyzed later."

221) You are developing an ASP.NET Core MVC web application. The web application must support older web browsers 
and implemented JavaScript features. You must use a polyfill to support the JavaScript Promise object in all browsers.
You need to implement a built-in ASP.NET Core Tag Helper to support polyfills. How should you complete the markup? 
To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
	<script asp-fallback-test="window.Promise"
			asp-fallback-src="https://unpkg.com/promise-polyfill@6.0.2">>
	</script>
</body>
</html>

Using the ASP.NET Core Script TagHelper to Polyfill The Latest JavaScript Features. The primary use case for fallbacks in the Script 
Tag Helper is checking if a CDN is down and loading a local script instead.  Another use case is you can use fallbacks to make it easy 
to polyfill missing JavaScript features in older browsers, while not having your users using the latest browsers take a network hit.

<script asp-fallback-test="window.Promise"
        asp-fallback-src="https://unpkg.com/promise-polyfill@6.0.2">

222) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application that will run on Azure. The application uses Event Tracing 
for Windows (ETW) for logging operations. You need to retrieve the ETW data for the application from a deployed 
Azure instance by using the Azure Diagnostics API.

Which data source should you use?

A. Azure Diagnostic infrastructure logs
B. Windows event logs
C. Performance counters
D. .NET EventSource

Correct Answer: D

Azure Diagnostics 1.2 and 1.3 are Azure extensions that enable you to collect diagnostic telemetry data
from a worker role, web role, or virtual machine running in Azure. 
Diagnostics 1.2 and 1.3 enable the collection of ETW and .NET EventSource events.

<EtwProviders>
	<EtwEventSourceProviderConfiguration provider="SampleEventSourceWriter" scheduledTransferPeriod="PT5M">
		<Event id="1" eventDestination="EnumsTable"/>
		<Event id="2" eventDestination="MessageTable"/>

223) You are developing an ASP.NET application that runs on Windows Server 2012. An exception is preventing a page from rendering.
You need to view the trace information for the page. Which two actions should you perform?

A. Add the following markup segment to the web.config file: <trace mostRecent= “true/”>
B. Load the trace.axd page from the root of the website.
C. Add the traceEnable element to the Internet Information Service (IIS) Metabase section for the application.
D. Add the following markup segment to the web.config file: <trace enabled= “true/”>

Answer: BD

Explanation:
D: You can control whether tracing is enabled or disabled for individual pages. If tracing is enabled, when the page is requested, 
ASP.NET appends to the page a series of tables containing execution details about the page request. Tracing is disabled by default. 
To enable tracing for a page You can also configure tracing in the Web.config file by setting the enabled, localOnly, and pageOutput 
attributes of the trace Element (ASP.NET Settings Schema)

B: To view trace details for a specific request Navigate to Trace.axd in the root of your application.
For example, if the URL for your application is http://localhost/SampleApplication, navigate to 
http://localhost/SampleApplication/trace.axd to view the trace information for that application.
Select the View Details link for the request that you want to investigate.

226) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application. The application provides a RESTful API for third-party applications. 
This API updates the information for a contact by embedding the information in the URL of an HTTP POST.
You need to save the Contact type when third-party applications use the EditContact method.
Which two code segments should you use?

A 
public IActionResult EditContact(FormCollection values)
{
	var c = new Contact()
	{
		FirstName = values["FirstName"],
		LastName = values["LastName"]
	};
	
	SaveContact(c);
	return View(c);

{
	SaveContact(c);
	return View(c);
}

C
public IActionResult EditContact()
{
	var c = new Contact()
	{
		FirstName = Request.QueryString["FirstName"],
		LastName = Request.QueryString["LastName"]
	};
	
	SaveContact(c);
	return View();
}

D

	{
		FirstName = values.GetValue["FirstName"],
		LastName = values.GetValue["LastName"]
	};
	
	SaveContact(c);
	return View(c);
}

Correct Answer: BC

The source data for the game results is updated every 30 seconds. Testers report the following issues with the application:

✑ They report seeing other user's name when they sign in to the application.
✑ They report delays in seeing the latest game results.

You need to correct the performance issues. Which two changes should you make to the code? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

A. Replace the code at line 07 with the following code segment:[OutputCache(Duration = 30, VaryByParam = "none", Location = OutputCacheLocation.Client, NoStore = true)] 
B. Replace the code at line 12 with the following code segment:[OutputCache(Duration = 30, VaryByParam = "none", Location = OutputCacheLocation.Server, NoStore = true)] 
C. Replace the code at line 07 with the following code segment:[OutputCache(Duration = 3600, VaryByParam = "none", Location = OutputCacheLocation.Server, NoStore = false)] 
D. Replace the code at line 12 with the following code segment:[OutputCache(Duration = 3600, VaryByParam = "none", Location = OutputCacheLocation.Client, NoStore = true)]

Answer: AB

B: They report delays in seeing the latest game results. This is the output of the GetResults() function. We decrease the Duration in the cache for this function from 3600 to 30. 
This is one line 12. 

A: They report seeing other user's name when they sign in to the application. This is the output of the GetUserInfo() function. We should change the OutputCacheLocation of the 
caching of this function from Server to Client. This is on line 7. 

Note: 
The OutputCacheLocation.Client option indicates that the content should be cached at the requesting client. Any requests for the same resource made from the same client within 
the expiry period, will be served out the client's cache, without a network request being made to the server. The OutputCacheLocation.Server option indicates that the content 
will be cached at the origin server. This content will be served for subsequent requests made by the initial client and any other client requesting the same resource within 
the expiry period.

In ASP.NET core you can use ResponseCache, example [ResponseCache(Duration = 60, Location = ResponseCacheLocation.Any, NoStore = false)]

228) A company has an enterprise library that targets the full .NET framework.
You must convert the library to target .NET Standard. You replace the original project file with a .NET Standard
project file. When you compile the library, the compiler throws the following errors:

error cs0579 duplicate 'system.reflection.AssemblyVersionAttribute' attribute
error cs0579 duplicate 'system.reflection.AssemblyCompanyAttribute' attribute

You need to resolve the errors. Which two actions should you perform?
	
A. Delete the bin folder and recompile the library.
B. Add the GenerateAssemblyInfo property to the .NET Standard project file set the value to False.
C. Add the GenerateAssemblyInfo property to the .NET Standard project file set the value to True.
D. Delete the Properties folder and recompile the library.

AB

As the name indicates, this will prevent the build process from generating the AssemblyInfo.cs file in project obj directories, 
thus preventing the duplicate attribute conflict.

230) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application. The application has a contact view that includes a form for editing the displayed contact.
You need to save the Contact object model when the form is posted back to the EditContact method using a POST method request.
Which two code segments should you use?

A. 
public ActionResult EditContact()
{
	var c = newContact()
	{
		FirstName = Request.QueryString["FirstName"],
		LastName = Request.QueryString["LastName"]
	};
	
	SaveContact(c);
	return View(c);
}

B. 
public ActionResult EditContact(Contact c)
{
	SaveContact(c);
	return View(c);
}

C. 
public ActionResult EditContact(FormCollection values)
{
	var c = newContact()
	{
		FirstName = values["FirstName"],
		LastName = values["LastName"]
	};
	
	SaveContact(c);
	return View(c);
}
D. 
public ActionResult EditContact(QueryStringProvider values)
{
	var c = newContact() 
	{
		FirstName = values.GetValue["FirstName"],
		LastName = values.GetValue["LastName"]
	};
	
	SaveContact(c);
	return View(c);}
}

Correct Answer: BC
B (De standard way to retrieve Post parameters), C (In .ASP.NET core you need to use IFormCollection)

Request.QueryString (Request.Query in .NET.Core) can only be used when parameters are in URL, Get method.

231) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC web application in Visual Studio 2012. The application has a model
named ReservationLocation that contains properties named City and State. The view that displays
reservations has a single text box named loc for entering the location information. The location is entered
as city, state. There are action methods that have ReservationLocation as a parameter type. You need to
ensure that the City and State properties are correctly populated. How should you implement model
binding for the ReservationLocation type? (To answer, drag the appropriate code segment to the correct
location or locations. Each code segment may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need
to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.) Working example code is shown below.

public class ReservationModelBinder : IModelBinder
{
	public Task BindModelAsync(ModelBindingContext bindingContext)
	{
		ValueProviderResult raw = bindingContext.ValueProvider.GetValue("loc");
		dynamic data = raw.FirstValue.Split(",");
		var result = new ReservationLocation()
		{
			City = data[0],
			State = data[1]
		};

		bindingContext.Result = ModelBindingResult.Success(result);
		return Task.CompletedTask;
	}
}
		
public class BookingController : Controller
{

	[HttpGet]
	public IActionResult Create()
	{
		return View();
	}

	[HttpPost]
	public IActionResult Create([ModelBinder(BinderType = typeof(ReservationModelBinder))] ReservationLocation reservationLocation)
	{
		return View();

232) Your company uses Microsoft Azure DevTest Labs for testing applications. The DevTest Labs environment must 
provide a preconfigured base image for a virtual machine that can be used for all development efforts. 
The virtual machine must be able to be reproduced in various environments. You need to provision the virtual machine.

What should you implement?

A. custom images
B. Marketplace images
C. formulas
D. artifacts

Correct Answer: C

Both custom images and formulas can be used as bases for created new VMs. However, the key distinction between 
custom images and formulas is that a custom image is simply an image based on a VHD, while a formula is an image 
based on a VHD in addition to preconfigured settings - such as VM Size, virtual network, subnet, and artifacts. 
These preconfigured settings are set up with default values that can be overridden at the time of VM creation. 
This article explains some of the advantages (pros) and disadvantages (cons) to using custom images versus using formulas.

235) You are developing an ASP.NET Core web application in Microsoft Visual Studio. The project uses a file named package.json 
in reusable packages. You must automate the build process to use a script minification strategy. Script minification must happen 
in parallel. You need to ensure you can share and distribute packages and run the minification strategy. Which tools should you use? 
To answer, drag the appropriate tools to the correct scenarios. Each tool may be used once, more than once, or not at all. 
You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.

Tools:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
236) You have two Microsoft Azure subscriptions. One subscription emits logs. You plan to deploy audit tools to
the other subscription to allow users to analyze logs that the first subscription emits. You perform the following actions:

=> Configure resource diagnostic logs for non-compute resources in the Azure portal
=> Use Event Hubs metrics and set the log category in OperationalLogs
=> Set a retention policy of seven days
=> Users report that no log files are available.
=> You need to ensure that log files are available for users.

What should you do?

A. Combine all tools and objects into the same subscription
B. Store the logs in a Storage account
C. Set the log category to Audit
D. Change the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) access in both subscriptions to match

Correct Answer: D

To enable streaming of the Activity Log, you pick an Event Hub Namespace and a shared access policy for
that namespace. An Event Hub is created in that namespace when the first new Activity Log event occurs.
You can use an event hub namespace that is not in the same subscription as the subscription emitting logs,
however the subscriptions must be in the same Azure Active Directory. Event Hubs offers shared access 
signatures and Azure Active Directory integration (to provide role based access control) for fine-grained control 
over a client’s access to resources. By default, all Event Hubs resources are secured, and are available only 
to the account owner. You can use either shared access signatures or Azure Active Directory integration as 
your authorization strategy to grant clients access to Event Hubs resources. Microsoft recommends using 
Azure AD when possible for maximum security and ease of use.

Not A: The Event Hub namespace does not have to be in the same subscription as the subscription
emitting logs. The user who configures the setting must have appropriate access permissions to both
subscriptions. If you have multiple subscriptions in the same Azure Active directory, you can send the
activity logs for all subscriptions to a single event hub.

Event Hubs represents the "front door" for an event pipeline, often called an event ingestor in solution architectures. 
An event ingestor is a component or service that sits between event publishers and event consumers to decouple the production 
of an event stream from the consumption of those events. Event Hubs provides a unified streaming platform with time retention 
buffer, decoupling event producers from event consumers. Event Hubs is a fully managed Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) with 
little configuration or management overhead.

Event Hubs is a fully managed, real-time data ingestion service that’s simple, trusted, and scalable. Stream millions of 
events per second from any source to build dynamic data pipelines and immediately respond to business challenges.
Integrate seamlessly with other Azure services to unlock valuable insights. Allow existing Apache Kafka clients and 
applications to talk to Event Hubs without any code changes.

Azure Event Hubs is a big data streaming platform and event ingestion service. It can receive and process millions of events per second. 
Data sent to an event hub can be transformed and stored by using any real-time analytics provider or batching/storage adapters.
The following scenarios are some of the scenarios where you can use Event Hubs:

=> Anomaly detection (fraud/outliers)
=> Application logging
=> Analytics pipelines, such as clickstreams
=> Live dashboarding
=> Archiving data
=> Transaction processing
=> User telemetry processing
=> Device telemetry streaming

237) You are developing an ASP.NET Core MVC web application that will be deployed to Microsoft Azure App Services Web App.
Scheduled downtime during deployment of new features is not permitted. You need to ensure that deployments do not result in downtime.

What should you do?

A. Add additional upgrade domains.
B. Use deployment slots during deployments.
C. Convert the Web App to run in a standalone Docker container.
D. Upgrade to a Premium App Service plan.

Answer: B

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
238) You develop a new ASP.NET MVC web application. The application is hosted in an Azure Web Role. It
includes the following code. 

public class WebRole : RoleEntryPoint
{
    public override bool OnStart()
    {
		...
		return base.OnStart();
	}

    public override bool Run()
    {
		...
	}

    public override bool OnStop()
    {
		Trace.TraceInformation("OnStop is called within Web Role.");
		var performanceCounterCurrentRequests = new PerformanceCounter("ASP.NET", "Requests Current", ""); 
		
		while(true)
		{
			var currentRequestCount = performanceCounterCurrentRequests.NextValue();
			Trace.TraceInformation("ASP.NET Requests Current = " + currentRequestCount);	
			if(currentRequestCount <= 0)
			{
				break;
			}
			
			Thread.Sleep(1000);
		}
			
		return base.OnStop();
	}
}

For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No.

1) When the Web Server is so busy that the pending requests cannot be completed within five minutes,
the Web Role is shut down. YES

2) When an unhandled exception occurs within the Web Role, the stopping event is raised, and the
OnStop method code runs. NO     

3) The Web Role initiates a shutdown immediately following the return of the OnStop method code. YES  

Notes:
If the OnStart method returns false, the role instance is immediately stopped. If the method returns true, Windows Azure starts the role by 
calling the Run method. In general, you should avoid returning false from the OnStart method. If an exception occurs within one of the lifecycle 
methods, Azure will raise the UnhandledException event, and then the process is terminated. After your role has been taken offline, it will be 
restarted by Azure. So you should avoid UnhandledException in the method. Any uncaught exception within an overload of a RoleEntryPoint method 
is treated as an unhandled exception. If an exception occurs within one of the lifecycle methods, Azure will raise the UnhandledException event, 
and then the process is terminated. After your role has been taken offline, it will be restarted by Azure. When an unhandled exception occurs, 
the Stopping event is not raised, and the OnStop method is not called.

239)You are developing a new ASP.NET MVC application that will be hosted on Microsoft Azure. You need to implement caching.
The caching solution must support the following:

✑ The cache must be able to store out-of-process (OutProc) ASP.NET session state.
✑ The cache must be able to store a variety of data types.
✑ The cache must offer a large amount of space for cached content.
✑ You must be able to share output cache content across web server instances.

You need to select a cache solution. Which caching solution should you choose?

A. ASP.NET Caching
B. Azure In-Role Cache
C. Azure Redis Cache
D. Azure Managed Cache Service

C

Azure Cache for Redis:
Azure Cache for Redis provides an in-memory data store based on the open-source software Redis. When used as a cache, 
Redis improves the performance and scalability of systems that rely heavily on backend data stores. Performance is improved 
by copying frequently accessed data to fast storage located close to the application. With Azure Cache for Redis, this fast 
storage is located in-memory instead of being loaded from disk by a database. Azure Cache for Redis can be used as a distributed 
data cache, a session store, and a message broker. Application performance is improved by taking advantage of the low-latency, 
high-throughput performance of the Redis engine. Azure Cache for Redis offers access to a secure, dedicated Redis cache. It is 
managed by Microsoft, hosted on Azure, and accessible to any application within or outside of Azure.

ASP.NET Caching possibilities in standalone Web Server and Web Farm: 
In a distributed environment, it is important to remember that that requests can be
distributed among different servers when using a session. There are three modes of session
management available in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS): InProc, StateServer,
and SQLServer. They each have advantages and disadvantages.
You can configure IIS to manage the SessionId either way. InProc mode is the default setting
and means that the web sessions are stored in the web server’s local memory. This option
provides the best performance but is not clusterable. In StateServer mode, session information
is stored in memory on a separate server. When configuring the state server in IIS, you
need to enter the connection string to the server. All servers that use the same state server
have access to the state information. SQLServer mode has the same advantage as StateServer
in that the session information is shared across multiple servers. It has a performance impact,
however, because there needs to be a call to a SQLServer and it will add latency to the session
access.

245) You are designing a distributed application that runs on the Microsoft Azure platform. The application must store a 
small amount of information that is shared cross all users and does not change frequently. You need to configure the application 
to meet the requirements. Which server-side state management option should you use? (Each correct answer presents a complete solution. 
Choose all that apply.)

A. Microsoft Azure application state
B. SQL Database
C. Profile properties of the Microsoft Azure application
D. Microsoft Azure session state

B

Not A: Windows azure application state doesn't exist
Not C: Profile properties stores personal, not global, information.
Not D: Session state is not global. Session states handles user information such as cookies, hidden fields, 
and query strings are some client-side options to tracking user state.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
247) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application. The application must allow users to enter JavaScript in a feedback text box only.
You need to disable request validation. What should you do?

A. Apply and set the CausesClientSideValidation attribute on the text box to FALSE.
B. Apply and set the ValidateInput attribute on the text box to FALSE.
C. Use the HttpRequest.Unvalidated property to read the unvalidated form value.
D. Use the HttpRequest.Form property to read the unvalidated form value.

C

The HttpRequest.Unvalidated property gets the HTTPrequest values without triggering request validation.
Request validation checks for HTML markup and script that might indicate a potential cross-site scripting attack. 
By default, all values are checked using request validation and if any values contain markup or script, ASP.NET 
throws an HttpRequestValidationException exception. Use this method if you anticipate that the request will contain 
markup (for example, you are allowing users to post content that contains markup) and you want to get the raw value of a request.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.httprequest.unvalidated?redirectedfrom=MSDN&view=netframework-4.8#System_Web_HttpRequest_Unvalidated

Note:
[ValidateInput(false)] is used to decorate a Action in controller, it is not used to set the attribute on the text box, hence C is the correct answer.

249)You are designing a distributed application. The application must store a small amount of insecure global information that 
does not change frequently. You need to configure the application to meet the requirements. Which server-side state management 
option should you use?  (Each correct answer presents a complete solution. Choose all that apply.)

A. Application state
B. Session state
C. Database support
D. Profile properties

C A(In for example the Cache, shared across users)

If the Application state uses Cache (StateServer), it can store global information.
 
In an ASP.NET MVC 4 application, state information can be stored in the following locations:
■■ Cache, which is a memory pool stored on the server and shared across users
■■ Session, which is stored on the server and unique for each user
■■ Cookies, which are stored on the client and passed with each HTTP request to the server
■■ QueryString, which is passed as part of the complete URL string
■■ Context.Items, which is part of the HttpContext and lasts only the lifetime of that request
■■ Profile, which is stored in a database and maintains information across multiple sessions

Application state is a data repository available to all classes in an ASP.NET application. Application state is stored 
in memory on the server and is faster than storing and retrieving information in a database. Unlike session state, which 
is specific to a single user session, application state applies to all users and all sessions. Therefore, application state 
is a useful place to store small amounts of often-used data that does not change from one user to another. The topics in 
this section provide information on how application state works and how to use it. SQL Database provides a relational 
database management system for Windows Azure and is based on SQL Server technology. With a SQL Database instance, you can 
easily provision and deploy relational database solutions to the cloud, and take advantage of a distributed data center that 
provides enterprise-class availability, scalability, and security with the benefits of built-in data protection and self-healing.

252) You are developing an application that supports multiple cultures. The application must store localized content 
in satellite assemblies. You need to build the satellite assemblies. Which tool should you use?

A. Gacutil.exe
B. Al.exe
C. Ildasm.exe
D. Ilasm.exe

B

Use the Assembly Linker (Al.exe) to compile .resources files into satellite assemblies. Al.exe creates an assembly from the .resources 
files that you specify. By definition, satellite assemblies can only contain resources. They cannot contain any executable code.
The following Al.exe command creates a satellite assembly for the application MyApp from the file strings.de.resources. 
al /t:lib /embed:strings.de.resources /culture:de /out:MyApp.resources.dll

Which command-line tool should you use?

A. Mage.exe
B. Ngen.exe
C. ALexe
D. Resgen.exe

A

The Manifest Generation and Editing Tool (Mage.exe) is a command-line tool that supports the creation and editing of application and deployment manifests.
Not B: The Native Image Generator (Ngen.exe) is a tool that improves the performance of managed applications. Ngen.exe creates native images
Not C: Al.exe generates a file with an assembly manifest, not an deployment manifest, from one or more files that are either resource files or Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL) files.
Not D: Resgen.exe, the Resource File Generator, converts text (.txt or .restext) files and XML-based resource format (.resx) files to common language runtime binary (.resources) files that can be embedded in a runtime binary executable or compiled into satellite assemblies.

257) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application that uses forms authentication to verify that the user is logged in.
Authentication credentials must be encrypted and secure so no user identity is exposed. You need to ensure that user credentials 
are persisted after users log on. In which two locations can you store the credentials? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

A. In Session on the server
B. In a cookie stored in the browser
C. In ViewData in the application
D. In TempData on the server

AB 

In general we do not want to store user credential anywhere other than the database? 
After the login is complete we may store the token in cookie, but not credentials!

Server sessions and cookies can both be configured to secure and they both persist after the users log on.
C: ViewData's life only lasts during current http request.
D: TempData is a bucket where you can dump data that is only needed for the following request. That is, anything you put into TempData is discarded after the next request completes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
258)You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application that uses forms authentication. The application uses SQL queries that display customer order data.
Logs show there have been several malicious attacks against the servers. You need to prevent all SQL injection attacks from malicious users against the application.
How should you secure the queries?

A. Check the input against patterns seen in the logs and other records.
B. Escape single quotes and apostrophes on all string-based input parameters.
C. Implement parameterization of all input strings.
D. Filter out prohibited words in the input submitted by the users.

C

SQL Injection Prevention, Defense Option 1: Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries)
The use of prepared statements (aka parameterized queries) is how all developers should first be taught how to write database queries. They are simple to write, and easier to understand than dynamic queries. Parameterized queries forcethe developer to first define all the SQL code, and then pass in each parameter to the query later. This coding style allows the database to distinguish between code and data, regardless of what user input is supplied.
Prepared statements ensure that anattacker is not able to change the intent of a query, even if SQL commands are inserted by an attacker.

259) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC web application that requires HTML elements to take on new behaviors. These should be implemented with a behavior script in 
a page that is only for Microsoft Internet Explorer users. The colorchange.js script uses the Microsoft CSS vendor-specific Behavior extension. You need to apply 
the script with CSS. You need to use the script to change the color of text. You have the following markup:

<h1 {style="behavior:|style="url:|style="behaviorurl:} {url(colorchange.js);"|behavior(colorchange.js);"|colorchange.js;"}>What a colorful header</h1>

Answer:

<h1 style="behavior: url(colorchange.js);">What a colorful header</h1>

260) You are building an ASP.NET MVC web application. The application will be viewed by users on their mobile phones.
You need to ensure that the page fits within the horizontal width of the device screens. You have the following markup:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
	<title>@ViewBag.Title</title>
	<{meta|area} {name="viewport|name="schema"} {content="width=device-width|content="user-scalable"}>
	<link href="@url.Content("~/Content/Site.css")" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>
	<script src="@url.Content("~/Content/Scripts/jquery.min.js") type="text/javascript"></script>
</head>

Which markup segments should you include in Target 1, Target 2 and Target 3 to complete the markup? (To answer, drag the 
appropriate markup segments to the correct targets. Each line of code may be used once, more than once, or not at all. 
You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.)

Answer

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
261) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application in Visual Studio 2012. The application will be viewed with browsers on desktop devices and mobile devices.
The application uses the Razor View Engine to display data. The application contains two layouts located in the /Views/Shared directory.
These layouts are named:

✑ _Layout.cshmtl
✑ _MobileLayout.cshtml

The application must detect if the user is browsing from a mobile device. If the user is browsing from a mobile device, the application must use the
_MobileLayout.cshtml file. If the user is browsing from a desktop device, the application must use _Layout.cshtml.
You need to ensure that the application renders the layout that is appropriate for the browser.
You have the following code:

@{
	if( Target_1 )
	{
		Target_2
	}
	else
	{
		Target_3
	}
}

Segments:
1) Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshmtl"
2) Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_MobileLayout.cshtml"
3) Layout = new MasterPage("_Layout.cshmtl");
4) Layout = new MasterPage("_MobileLayout.cshmtl");
5) Request.Browser.IsMobileDevice;
6) Request.Browser.IsBrowser("MobileDevice");

Answer:

Target_1 = Request.Browser.IsMobileDevice; (5) 
Target_2 = Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_MobileLayout.cshtml" (2)
Target_3 = Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshmtl" (1)

262) You are developing an application that uses many small images for various aspects of the interface.
The application responds slowly when additional resources are being accessed.
You need to improve the performance of the application. What should you do?

A. Preload all the images when the client connects to ensure that the images are cached.
B. Combine all the images into a single image and use CSS to create sprites.
C. Host all images on an alternate server and provide a CDN.

C (Preferred by Azure) and B,  

Note
Azure recommends hosting CDNs for all static files. In the question there is big stress on loading performance of many small images. 
It is obvious that sprites are meant and were invented to solve exactly that problem. So in my opinion for sure it is true that 
sprites would help solving given problem, regardless of any sort of MS recommendation. you don't need 3rd party tool to create sprite, 
just an image that combines all images and css.

263) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application in Visual Studio. The application supports multiple cultures.
To set the culture, the application must use the AcceptLanguage header field value sent by the client browser.
You need to ensure that the application can set the culture. You have the following markup in the web.config file: 

<system.web>
	<Target_1
	Target_2 = "true"
	Target_3 = "auto"
	culture = "auto" />
</system.web>

Choices
1) globalization 
2) enableClientBasedCulture
3) uiCulture
4) siteMap
5) configSource

Answer

Target_1: globalization
Target2: enableClientBasedCulture
Target3: uiCulture

When the EnableClientBasedCulture property is enabled, the Culture and UICulture properties are based on the AcceptLanguage header field value that is sent by the client browser. 
If the AcceptLanguage header value cannot be mapped to a specific culture, the Culture and UICulture values are used. The default value is false.
The following combination of attributes is used in the globalization section: culture="auto", uiCulture="auto", enableClientBasedCulture="true", e.g.:
<globalization uiCulture="auto" culture="auto" enableClientBasedCulture="true">

264) You are designing a localized ASP.NET MVC online shopping application that will be deployed to customers in the United States, China, France, and Brazil. The application must support multiple cultures so that content in the appropriate language is available in each area.
You need to ensure that the content can be viewed in several languages. How should you implement this feature?

A. Use a resource (.resx) file to provide translations.
B. Use Systems.Collections.Generics.Dictionary to store alternative translations.
C. Ensure that all strings are marked internal to avoid conflict with internal literals.
D. Include language-specific content in the assembly manifest and use .NET culture libraries.

A

A resource file is an XML file that contains the strings that you want to translate into different languages or paths to images. The resource file contains key/value pairs. Each pair is an individual resource. Key names are not case sensitive. For example, a resource file might contain a resource with the key Button1 and the value Submit.
You create a separate resource file for each language (for example, English and French) or for a language and culture (for example English [U.K.], English [U.S.]).
Each localized resource file has the same key/value pairs; the only difference is that a localized resource file can contain fewer resources than the default resource file. The built-in language fallback process then handles loading the neutral or default resource.

265) You are designing am ASP.NET Core MVC application. The application must store secure information that is specific to an individual user. 
The data must be automatically purged when the user logs off. You need to save transient information in a secure data store. Which data store should you use?

A. Session state
B. Database storage
C. Profile properties
D. Application state

A 

ASP.NET session state enables you to store and retrieve values for a user as the user navigates ASP.NET pages in a Web application. 
HTTP is a stateless protocol. This means that a Web server treats each HTTP request for a page as an independent request. The server 
retains no knowledge of variable values that were used during previous requests. ASP.NET session state identifies requests from the 
same browser during a limited time window as a session, and provides a way to persist variable values for the duration of that session.

You can use Session State outproc , using the SQL Option you get the security & purged data.
I understood that the data needs to be stored/saved in transient manner but not persisted anywhere. Data in DB storage is not transient by design so I think it is 
wrong answer (B is wrong IMO). Only A - session state is transient, safe and user-specific. App state is non-user-specific - that is why that one is wrong too. 
Profile properties is persisted so it is not transient as session state.

266) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application in a web farm. The application has a page that accepts a customer's order, processes it, 
and then redirects the browser to a page where the order is displayed along with the shipping information. The order information should be available 
only to the page where the order is displayed. You need to store state and configure the application. What should you do? To answer, drag the appropriate 
item to the correct location. Each item may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.
Select and Place:

1) TempData
2) ViewDate
3) InProc
4) SQLServer

Answer:

Store state in {TempData (1)} and set the mode attribute of the
sessionState element in Web.config file to {SQLServer (2)}.  

Note:
TempData and NOT ViewData because of redirection which would empty the ViewData. Redirection is new request and ViewData stores data 
only for the current request, not subsequent ones as TempData does. TempData will be cleared out after requesting data. 
Call TempData.Keep() to retain TempData values in a third consecutive request.
https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/mvc/tempdata-in-asp.net-mvc

InProc sessions and web farms should not be combined.

A StateServer configuration for configuring sessionState is as follows:
<system.web>
	<sessionState mode="SQLServer"
				  sqlConnectionString="data source=127.0.0.1;user id=<username>;password=<strongpassword>"
				  cookieless="false" 
				  timeout="20"/>

267) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application that will run on Azure. The application uses Event Tracing for Windows 
(ETW) for logging operations. You need to retrieve the ETW data for the application from a deployed Azure instance by using 
the Azure Diagnostics API. Which data source should you use?

A. Azure Diagnostic infrastructure logs
B. Windows event logs
C. performance counters
D. .NET EventSource

D

Azure Diagnostics 1.2 and 1.3 are Azure extensions that enable you to collect diagnostic telemetry data from a worker role, 
web role, or virtual machine running in Azure. Diagnostics 1.2 and 1.3 enable the collection of ETW and .NET EventSource events.

Example:
EtwProviders>
<EtwEventSourceProviderConfiguration provider="SampleEventSourceWriter" scheduledTransferPeriod="PT5M">
<Event id="1" eventDestination="EnumsTable"/>
<Event id="2" eventDestination="MessageTable"/>
<Event id="3" eventDestination="SetOtherTable"/>
<Event id="4" eventDestination="HighFreqTable"/>
<DefaultEvents eventDestination="DefaultTable" />

268) You develop an ASP.NET MVC application. The application has a controller named PeopleController.cs. 
The controller has an action method that returns a parent view. The parent view includes the following code. 

	@model PartialView.Models.PersonViewModel
	@{
		ViewBag.Title = "People";
	}

	<div>
		<h1>@ViewBag.Title</h1>
	</div>
	<div>
09)---------------------
	</div>

The application also contains a partial view named People. The parent view must display the partial view.
You need to add code at line 09 to display the partial view within the parent view.
Which two code segments will achieve the goal? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

A. @{ Html.RenderPartial("People", Model);}
B. @Html.Partial("People", Model)
C. @Html.Display("People", Model)
D. @Html.Raw("People")

AB

By default, any partial view rendered bycalling @Html.Partial("PartialViewName") will get the view model passed to the parent view.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
269)You need to enable client-side validation for an ASP.NET MVC application.
Which three actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

A. Attach a custom validation attribute to the model properties that the view uses.
B. Reference the jquery, jquery.validate and jquery.validate.unobtrusive script files in the view.
C. Open the web.config file at the project root, and set the values of the ClientValidationEnabled and UnobtrusiveJavaScriptEnabled keys to True.
D. For each form element, use the Validator.element() method to validate each item.
E. Add data annotations to the model properties that the view uses.

BCE

B: The validation can be implemented using jQuery and jQuery validation plug-in (jquery.validate.min.js and jquery.validate.unobtrusive.min.js).
C: When you are developing an MVC application in Visual Studio 2012 then the client-side becomes enabled by default, but you can easily enable or 
disable the writing of the following app setting code snippet in the web.config file.
<configuration>
<appSettings>
<add key="ClientValidationEnabled" value="true" />
<add key="UnobtrusiveJavaScriptEnabled" value="true" />
</appSettings>
</configuration>
E: The jQuery validation plug-in takes advantage of the Data Annotation attributes defined in the model, which means that you need to do very little to start using it.

271) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application. Before an action is executed, information about the action must be written 
to a log. After results are returned, information about the results also must be written to the log. You need to log the actions and results.
You have the following code: 

Target_1
{
	public override void Target_2
	{
		Logger.Log("ActionLog", filterContext.RouteData);
	}

	public override void Target_3
	{
		Logger.Log("ResultLog", filterContext.RouteData);
	}
}

Which code segments should you include in Target 1, Target 2 and Target 3 to implement the LogActionFilter class? 
(To answer, select the appropriate option from the drop-down list in the answer area.)

1) OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext)
2) OnActionExecuted (ActionExecutedContext filterContext)
3) OnResultExecuting(ResultExecutingContext filterContext)
4) OnResultExecuted (ResultExecutedContext filterContext)
5) public class LogActionFilter : ActionFilterAttribute
6) public class LogActionFilter : IActionFilter

Answer:

Target_1 = public class LogActionFilter : ActionFilterAttribute
Target_2 = OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext)
Target_3 = OnResultExecuted (ResultExecutedContext filterContext)

The execution order of these events is as follows:
1. OnActionExecuting
2. OnActionExecuted
3. OnResultExecuting
4. OnResultExecuted

ActionFilterAttribute, because "override" keyword can't be used with interface.
OnResultExecuting is Called before the action result from the action is processed.
After action result is returned, information about the results also must be written to the log, 
hence we need to use OnResultExecuted().
Use OnActionExecuting because log should be written before Action method is Executed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
272) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application in Visual Studio. The application contains an area called External.
The ActionLink method must invoke the GetOrders() action in ExternalOrderController. You need to configure the parameters 
of the ActionLink method. You have the following markup.

<li>
	@Html.ActionLink("ViewExternalOrders", Target_1, Target_2, new { Area = Target_3 }, null); 
</li>

Which markup segments should you include in Target 1, Target 2 and Target 3 to complete the markup? To answer, drag the 
appropriate markup segment to the correct targets. Each markup segment may be used once, more than once, or not at all. 
You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content. Select and Place:

1) GetOrders
2) ExternalOrder
3) External
4) ExternalOrderController

Answer

Target_1 = GetOrders		//ActionMethod
Target_2 = ExternalOrder	//Controller
Target_3 = External			//Area 

General syntax.
Html.ActionLink("Link Text", "ActionName", "ControllerName", new { Area = "AreaName" }, new{})

A. Update the report logic to include the custom business logic. Use WebDAV to publish the reports to the server.
B. Develop a new HTTP module that includes the custom business logic. Deploy the HTTP module to IIS.
C. Develop a new HTTP handler that includes the custom business logic. Deploy the HTTP handler to IIS.
D. Develop a new ISAPI filter that includes the custom business logic. Deploy the ISAPI filter to IIS.

C

An ASP.NET HTTP handler is the process that runs in response to a request that is made to an ASP.NET Web application.
ASP.NET maps HTTP requests to HTTP handlers based on a file name extension.

Not B: HTTP modules differ from HTTP handlers. An HTTP handler returns a response to a request that is identified by a file name extension or family of file
name extensions. In contrast, an HTTP module is invoked for all requests and responses. It subscribes to event notifications in the request pipeline and lets 
you run code in registered event handlers.

278) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application to be used on the Internet. The environment does not use Active Directory.
Users must be able to log on to the application to maintain their personal preferences.
You need to use the least amount of development effort to enable users to log on. What should you do?

A. Enable Digest authentication.
B. Enable Windows authentication.
C. Enable Forms authentication.
D. Generate server SSL certificates and install them in IIS.

C

Many Web applications require a way to restrict access to some resources (such as specific pages) so that those resources are accessible only to authenticated users. 
The default Web application project template for ASP.NET MVC provides a controller, data models, and views that you can use to add ASP.NET forms authentication to 
your application. The built-in functionality lets users register, log on and off, and change their password. For many applications, this functionality provides a 
sufficient level of user authentication.

Incorrect:
Not B: Windows authentication would require an Active Directory.
Windows authentication method works only if the following two conditions exist:
✑ You set up your network to use the Kerberos authentication protocol that requires Active Directory.
✑ You set up the computers and accounts on your network as trusted for delegation.
References:
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff398049(VS.98).aspx

Note:
For Digest authentication the users of the system need to have accounts, either in Active Directory or on the server.
Digest authentication uses a challenge-response mechanism to ensure that the user credentials required for authentication are not sent 
in clear text (without encryption). Thus, users of the system need to have accounts, either in Active Directory or on the server. When 
you set up Digest authentication on the server, you can choose a default domain that will be used if the user does not provide one with 
the login information. If no default domain is specified, and the user does not provide one, the authentication will be attempted against 
the local server store. If that fails, the authentication request will be rejected.

For Windows authentication the process of logging in through a Windows account.
Windows authentication, as its name implies, manages the process of logging in through
a Windows account. There are two authentication protocols: NTLM and Kerberos. These
protocols are supported only in Microsoft browsers because Windows authentication doesn’t
require the user to provide login credentials; instead, the server retrieves the user’s login 
information from the browser’s credentials cache. Windows authentication, therefore, provides 
for a single sign-on experience for users who have already logged in to the domain, such as from 
their desktop computer. Although there are some limiting factors, such as proxy settings, usage 
is straightforward and easy to implement, especially on an intranet.

279) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application that will run in a shared environment. The application requests the 
user's password, and then uses the password to sign data. You need to minimize the potential for the password to be 
discovered by other processes that run in the shared environment. What should you do?

A. Add the SecuritySafeCriticalAttribute attribute to the methods which process the password.
B. Store the password in a SecureString instance.
C. Encrypt the password on the web page, and decrypt the password in the MVC application.
D. Run the code that processes the password in its own AppDomain.

D

Application domains provide a unit of isolation for the common language runtime. They are created and run inside a process. Application domains are usually created by a runtime host, which is an application responsible for loading the runtime into a process and executing user code within an application domain. The runtime host creates a process and a default application domain, and runs managed code inside it. Runtime hosts include ASP.NET, Microsoft Internet Explorer, and the Windows shell.
For most applications, you do not need to create your own application domain; the runtime host creates any necessary application domains for you. However, you can create and configure additional application domains if your application needs to isolate code or to use and unload DLLs.

280) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application. The application uses a set of custom exceptions to log errors that occur during the execution of an action.
You need to develop a class that implements logging. Which interface should you implement?

A. IExceptionFilter
B. IActionFilter
C. IClientValidatable
D. IResultFilter

A
Exception filters are used to apply global policies to unhandled exceptions in the MVC app.
Exception Filters implement either the IExceptionFilter or IAsyncExceptionFilter interface.
Exception filters handle unhandled exceptions, including those that occur during controller creation and model binding. They are only called when an exception occurs in the pipeline.

281) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application. You need to choose the appropriate Visual Studio templates to use for each test goal.
Which Visual Studio Unit Test project templates should you use? To answer, drag the appropriate Unit Test project template to the correct test goal or test goals.
Each project template may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.
Select and Place:

Choices:

1) Coded UI Test project
2) Unit Test Project
3) Web Performance and Load Test Project

Answer 

Validate the input controls on a Web application. => (1) Coded UI Test project
Test the internal validity of calculations in class methods. => (2) Unit Test Project
Test the Web Application speed while retrieving data from SQL server. => (3) Web Performance and Load Test Project
Validate the number of simultaneous users for a social portal. => (3) Web Performance and Load Test Project

Box 1: Coded UI Test Project -
Automated tests that drive your application through its user interface (UI) are known as coded UI tests (CUITs). These tests include functional testing of the UI controls. They let you verify that the whole application, including its user interface, is functioning correctly. Coded UI Tests are particularly useful where there is validation or other logic in the user interface, for example in a web page. They are also frequently used to automate an existing manual test.

Box 2: Unit Test Project -
Unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code, sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.[1] Intuitively, one can view a unit as the smallest testable part of an application.
Box 3: Web Performance and Load Test Project
Box 4: Web Performance and Load Test Project
A load test is a container of Web performance tests and unit tests.
A load test exposes many run-time properties that can be modified to generate the desired load simulation.

282) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application. Devices that use many different browsers will use the application.
You have the following requirements:

✑ Content must display correctly when a device is in landscape or portrait orientation.
✑ Content must not scale when the device orientation changes.
✑ Content must be displayed by using the maximum available screen space.
✑ The application must render properly in Internet Explorer 8 or later versions.

You need to configure the application. Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

A. Use JavaScript to evaluate the window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight properties.
B. Set the value of the width property for the viewport meta tag to device-width.
C. Use CSS to target the HTML element on each page. Set the values of the width and height properties to 100%.
D. Use CSS media queries to target screen size, device orientation, and other browser capabilities.

BD
B: If you want the viewport width to match the device's physical pixels, you can specify the following:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
For this to work correctly, you must not explicitly force elements to exceed that width (e.g., using a width attribute or CSS property), otherwise the browser will be forced to use a larger viewport regardless.
D: Media queries in CSS3 extend the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they look at the capability of the device.
Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:
width and height of the viewport
width and height of the device
orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?) resolution
Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to tablets, iPhone, and Androids.

283) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application. The application includes the following HomeController class. Line numbers are included for reference only.

[HandleError]
public HomeController : Controller 
{
	public IActionResult Index()
	{
		Return View()
	}
}

During testing, all errors display an ASP.NET error page instead of the expected error view.
You need to ensure that the error view displays when errors occur. What should you do?

A. Replace line 01 with the following code segment: [HandleError(View="Error")]
B. In the web.config file, set the value of the customErrors property to On.
C. Replace line 01 with the following code segment: [HandleError(ExceptionType=typeof(SystemException))]
D. Create a custom error page named Error.aspx. Save the file in the Views\Shared folder for the project.

Enabling Custom Error Handling -
To enable custom error handling for use by a HandleErrorAttribute filter, add a customErrors element to the system.web section of the application's Web.config file, 
as shown in the following example:
<system.web>
<customErrors mode="On" defaultRedirect="Error" />
</system.web>
Note:
The HandleErrorAttribute attribute in ASP.NET MVC lets you specify how to handle an exception that is thrown by an action method. By default, when an action method 
with theHandleErrorAttribute attribute throws any exception, MVC displays the Error view that is located in the ~/Views/Shared folder.
Setting HandleErrorAttribute Properties
You can modify the default behavior of the HandleErrorAttribute filter by setting the following properties:
✑ ExceptionType. Specifies the exception type or types that the filter will handle. If this property is not specified, the filter handles all exceptions.
✑ View. Specifies the name of the view to display.
✑ Master. Specifies the name of the master view to use, if any.
✑ Order. Specifies the order in which the filters are applied, if more than one HandleErrorAttribute filter is possible for a method.

285) You are developing an ASP.NET application. You need to minimize the amount of data in all HTTP responses.
What should you do?

A. Minify the content files.
B. Enable compression in IIS.
C. Host the image, JavaScript, and CSS files on Microsoft Azure Storage.
D. Bundle the content files.

B
Network bandwidth is a limited resource. Reducing the size of the response usually increases the responsiveness of an app, often dramatically. One way to reduce payload sizes is to compress an app's responses. Use server-based response compression technologies in IIS, Apache, or Nginx.

289) You develop an ASP.NET MVC application. The application has several Razor views. The application must execute different 
server-side code for desktop and mobile devices. You need to choose an approach to support mobile devices.
Which two approaches can you use? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

A. Use different controllers and view for both desktop and mobile browsers, but render the views using Bootstrap framework.
B. Create separate areas for desktop and mobile browsers, implementing independent controllers and views for each.
C. Use the same controllers for both desktop and mobile browsers, but render different views depending on the device type.
D. Use different controllers and views for both desktop and mobile browsers, but render the views with the same Razor layout depending on the device type

BD

How ASP.NET MVC applications can present mobile-specific pages
Since the Model-View-Controller pattern decouples application logic (in controllers) from presentation logic (in views), you can choose from any of the following approaches to handling mobile support in server-side code:
1. Create separate areas for desktop and mobile browsers, implementing independent controllers and views for each. This option works best if you're displaying very different screens, containing different information and leading the user through different workflows optimized for their device type. It may mean some repetition of code, but you can minimize that by factoring out common logic into an underlying layer or service.
2. Use the same controllers for both desktop and mobile browsers, but render different views depending on the device type. This option works best if you're displaying roughly the same data and providing the same workflows for end users, but want to render very different HTML markup to suit the device being used.
3. Use the same controllers and views for both desktop and mobile browsers, but render the views with different Razor layouts depending on the device type.
This option works best if you're displaying identical data on all devices, but simply want to supply different CSS stylesheets or change a few top-level HTML elements for mobiles.

291) You are developing an ASP.NET application that runs on Windows Server 2012.
An exception is preventing a page from rendering. You need to view the trace information for the page.
Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

A. Add the following markup segment to the web.config file: <trace mostRecent= "true/">
B. Load the trace.axd page from the root of the website.
C. Add the traceEnable element to the Internet Information Service (IIS) Metabase section for the application.
D. Add the following markup segment to the web.config file: <trace enabled= "true/">

BD

D: You can control whether tracing is enabled or disabled for individual pages. If tracing is enabled, when the page is requested, 
ASP.NET appends to the page a series of tables containing execution details about the page request. Tracing is disabled by default.

To enable tracing for a page -
1. Include an @ Page directive at the top of your .aspx file.
2. Add a Trace attribute and set its value to true, as shown in the following example:
<%@ Page Trace="true" %>
You can also configure tracing in the Web.config file by setting the enabled, localOnly, and pageOutput attributes of the trace Element (ASP.NET Settings
Schema)
B: To view trace details for a specific request
Navigate to Trace.axd in the root of your application.
For example, if the URL for your application is http://localhost/SampleApplication, navigate to http://localhost/SampleApplication/trace.axd to view the trace information for that application.
Select the View Details link for the request that you want to investigate.

292) You are designing a distributed application. The application must store a small amount of information that is shared across all users and does not change frequently.
You need to configure the application to meet the requirements.
Which server-side state management options will achieve the goal? Each correct answer presents a complete solution. Choose all that apply.

A. Database support
B. Profile properties
C. Session state
D. Application state

AD

A: SQL Database provides a relational database management system for Windows Azure and is based on SQL Server technology. With a SQL Database instance, you can easily provision and deploy relational database solutions to the cloud, and take advantage of a distributed data center that provides enterprise- class availability, scalability, and security with the benefits of built-in data protection and self-healing.
D: Application state is a data repository available to all classes in an ASP.NET application. Application state is stored in memory on the server and is faster than storing and retrieving information in a database. Unlike session state, which is specific to a single user session, application state applies to all users and sessions.
Therefore, application state is a useful place to store small amounts of often-used data that does not change from one user to another.
Incorrect Answers:
B: Profile properties stores personal, not global, information.
C: Session state is not global. Session states handles user information such as cookies, hidden fields, and query strings are some client-side options to tracking user state
D: Application State does not exist in Azure.

A. Yes
B. No

B

Traditional ASP.NET (up to MVC 5) is tightly coupled to IIS through System.Web.dll. ASP.NET Core provides a separation between the web server and your web application. This allows web applications to be portable between different web servers and also allows web servers to be self-hosted, which means you can start a web server in your own process, as opposed to a process that is owned by dedicated web server software such as IIS.

300) You define a startup task in the ServiceDefinition.csdef file. The task consists of a batch file that runs a Windows PowerShell script. 
The script places configuration files in local storage for use in a worker role. The worker role needs this information before starting.
The worker role does not start after the startup task runs.
You need to ensure that the worker role starts. What should you do?

A. Use environment variables based on members of the RoleEnvironment class instead of static environment variables.
B. Configure the task to use the directory specified by the TEMP environment variable.
C. Ensure the task completes with an errorlevel of 0.
D. Change the task from simple to foreground

C

Startup tasks must end with an errorlevel (or exit code) of zero for the startup process to complete. If a startup task ends with a non-zero errorlevel, the role will not start.
Note: Startup tasks are actions that are taken before your roles begin and are defined in the ServiceDefinition.csdef file by using the Task element within the
Startup element. Frequently startup tasks are batch files, but they can also be console applications, or batch files that start PowerShell scripts.

319)You plan to deploy an ASP.NET Core MVC web application to an internal server cluster that runs Kestrel on Linux. The server cluster hosts many other web applications. All applications are behind a Nginx load balancer.
You need to ensure that the application meets the following requirements:
✑ Secure against man-in-the-middle attacks.
✑ Allow Open ID Connect authentication.
✑ Cache responses using HTTP caching.
Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
A. Bind Kestrel to port 0.
B. Terminate Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) in Kestrel.
C. Configure ASP.NET Core to use forwarded headers.
D. Enable the proxy_cache_bypass module.

AC

A: When the port number 0 is specified, Kestrel dynamically binds to an available port. When the app is run, the console window output indicates the dynamic port where the app can be reached.
C: Because requests are forwarded by reverse proxy, we must use the Forwarded Headers Middleware from the Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpOverrides package.
The middleware updates the Request.Scheme, using the X-Forwarded-Proto header, so that redirect URIs and other security policies work correctly.

320)You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application. Devices that use many different browsers will use the application.
You have the following requirements:
✑ Content must display correctly when a device is in landscape or portrait orientation.
✑ Content must not scale when the device orientation changes.
✑ Content must be displayed by using the maximum available screen space.
✑ The application must render properly in Internet Explorer 8 or later versions.
You need to configure the application.
Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.
A. Use JavaScript to evaluate the window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight properties.
B. Set the value of the width property for the viewport meta tag to device-width.
C. Use CSS to target the HTML element on each page. Set the values of the width and height properties to 100%.
D. Use CSS media queries to target screen size, device orientation, and other browser capabilities.

BD

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-window-innerwidth-and-innerheight-properties/

B: If you want the viewport width to match the devices physical pixels, you can specify the following:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
For this to work correctly, you must not explicitly force elements to exceed that width (e.g., using a width attribute or CSS property), otherwise the browser will be forced to use a larger viewport regardless.
D: Media queries in CSS3 extend the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they look at the capability of the device.
Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:
width and height of the viewport
width and height of the device
orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?) resolution
Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to tablets, iPhone, and Androids.

321)You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application.
The application must allow users to enter JavaScript in a feedback text box only.
You need to disable request validation.
What should you do?
A. Apply and set the CausesClientSideValidation attribute on the text box to FALSE.
B. Apply and set the ValidateInput attribute on the text box to FALSE.
C. Use the HttpRequest.Unvalidated property to read the unvalidated form value.
D. Use the HttpRequest.Form property to read the unvalidated form value.
E. Apply and set the CausesValidation attribute on the controller action to FALSE.
F. Apply and set the ValidateInput attribute on the controller action to FALSE.

C (F could be possible if it is applied to one action only and not to the complete controller, possible security breach)

The HttpRequest.Unvalidated property gets the HTTP request values without triggering request validation.
Request validation checks for HTML markup and script that might indicate a potential cross-site scripting attack. By default, all values are checked using request validation and if any values contain markup or script, ASP.NET throws an HttpRequestValidationException exception. Use this method if you anticipate that the request will contain markup (for example, you are allowing users to post content that contains markup) and you want to get the raw value of a request.

326) You are developing the landing page for an ASP.NET Core MVC web application that will be used to host blogs. You are implementing a View component to show text links for common application operations.
Users must be able to customize the HTML for landing pages.
You need to ensure that the links for common operations reflect the desired layout of the application when links are embedded into customized views.
Which CSS measurement unit should you use for the links?
A. vh
B. em
C. rem
D. px

B

The em and rem units are practical in creating perfectly scalable layout.
Rem scales depending on the value set in the root <html>. meaning 1rem for a <h1> and a <p> will have the same pixel size, which does not reflect the users desired layout.
em scales the size based on that particular tag. Em alows you to beter adapt to font size of the landing pages that the user might use, so the text in the links will scale beter with em.

Description Explanation: In case you dont want to use the RDP certificate created by Windows Azure Tools and want to use a custom certificate instead, the following steps 
will guide you. These steps can also be used in case package is not being published from Visual Studio rather it is being built locally, saved in either Local Machine's Drive 
or Windows Azure Blob Storage and subsequently published from there. Here are the steps which are required to get pass the publishing error which you might be running into. 
You would need to upload the Certificate with Private Key to the portal (when Visual Studio is used this is done in the background). Detailed steps. 1. In Visual Studio, 
go to the solution which is being developed. 2. Right click the Web Project -> Configure Remote Desktop -> click on View to see Certificate details 
(Since I dont have a custom certificate I will use one create by Windows Azure Tools itself) 3. Go to Details tab on Certificate -> Click Copy to file.. -> Next -> 
Select Yes, export the private key -> Next -> Continue with default setting and create a password when asked (please refer below screenshots) 4. 
These steps will generate a .PFX file for this certificate. Now we need to upload this certificate to the portal (for the respective cloud service) 5. Go to the 
Azure Management Portal -> Go to the Cloud Service in question -> Certificates Tab -> Upload the newly created certificate (.PFX file) Note: * 
The certificates that you need for a remote desktop connection are different from the certificates that you use for other Azure operations. 
The remote access certificate must have a private key. * Microsoft Azure uses certificates in three ways: / Management certificates Stored at the subscription level, 
these certificates are used to enable the use of the SDK tools, the Windows Azure Tools for Microsoft Visual Studio, or the Service Management REST API Reference. 
These certificates are independent of any cloud service or deployment. / Service certificate

You develop an ASP.NET Core MVC web application. You have a legacy business system that sends data to the web application by using Web API. The legacy business system uses proprietary data formats.
You need to handle the proprietary data format.
Solution: Add a custom formatter class to the Web API and implement the IInputFormatter interface.
Does the solution meet the goal?
A. Yes
B. No

Web API needs to convert the proprietary data format to the required data format before it makes it available to the ASP.NET Core MVC web application.
Hence we need OutputFormatter in the Web API.

A: SQL Database provides a relational database management system for Windows Azure and is based on SQL Server technology. With a SQL Database instance, you can easily provision and deploy relational database solutions to the cloud, and take advantage of a distributed data center that provides enterpriseclass availability, scalability, and security with the benefits of built-in data protection and self-healing.
D: Application state is a data repository available to all classes in an ASP.NET application. Application state is stored in memory on the server and is faster than storing and retrieving information in a database. Unlike session state, which is specific to a single user session, application state applies to all users and sessions. Therefore, application state is a useful place to store small amounts of often-used data that does not change from one user to another.
Incorrect Answers:
B: Profile properties stores personal, not global, information.
C: Session state is not global. Session states handles user information such as cookies, hidden fields, and query strings are some client-side options to tracking user state
D: Application State does not exist in Azure.

What should you do?
A. Minify the content files.
B. Enable compression in IIS.
C. Host the image, JavaScript, and CSS files on Microsoft Azure Storage.
D. Bundle the content files.

B

Explanation/Reference:
Network bandwidth is a limited resource. Reducing the size of the response usually increases the responsiveness of an app, often dramatically. One way to reduce payload sizes is to compress an app’s responses. Use server-based response compression technologies in IIS, Apache, or Nginx.

452) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application that will run in a shared environment.
The application requests the user’s password, and then uses the password to sign data.
You need to minimize the potential for the password to be discovered by other processes that run in the shared environment. What should you do?
A. Add the SecuritySafeCriticalAttribute attribute to the methods which process the password.
B. Store the password in a SecureString instance.
C. Encrypt the password on the web page, and decrypt the password in the MVC application.
D. Run the code that processes the password in its own AppDomain.

D

Application domains provide a unit of isolation for the common language runtime. They are created and run inside a process. Application domains are usually created by a runtime host, which is an application responsible for loading the runtime into a process and executing user code within an application domain. The runtime host creates a process and a default application domain, and runs managed code inside it. Runtime hosts include ASP.NET, Microsoft Internet
Explorer, and the Windows shell.
For most applications, you do not need to create your own application domain; the runtime host creates any necessary application domains for you. However, you can create and configure additional application domains if your application needs to isolate code or to use and unload DLLs.

What should you do?
A. Enable Digest authentication.
B. Enable Windows authentication.
C. Enable Forms authentication.
D. Generate server SSL certificates and install them in IIS.

C

Many Web applications require a way to restrict access to some resources (such as specific pages) so that those resources are accessible only to authenticated users. The default Web application project template for ASP.NET MVC provides a controller, data models, and views that you can use to add ASP.NET forms authentication to your application. The built-in functionality lets users register, log on and off, and change their password. For many applications, this functionality provides a sufficient level of user authentication.
Incorrect:
Not B: Windows authentication would require an Active Directory.
Windows authentication method works only if the following two conditions exist:
You set up your network to use the Kerberos authentication protocol that requires Active Directory. You set up the computers and accounts on your network as trusted for delegation. References: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ ff398049(VS.98).aspx

455)You deploy an ASP.NET MVC Web application to Internet Information Services (IIS). The application has a secure area that provides access to custom reports.
You must develop custom business logic to support the reports. The custom business logic has the following requirements:
It must run each time that a report is requested.
It must not run for other IIS requests.
It must be mapped to the request extension of the report.
It must be written by using a managed language that is supported by the .NET framework.
You must be able to quickly modify and deploy updates to the business logic.
You need to develop the custom business logic.
What should you do?
A. Update the report logic to include the custom business logic. Use WebDAV to publish the reports to the server.
B. Develop a new HTTP module that includes the custom business logic. Deploy the HTTP module to IIS.
C. Develop a new HTTP handler that includes the custom business logic. Deploy the HTTP handler to IIS.
D. Develop a new ISAPI filter that includes the custom business logic. Deploy the ISAPI filter to IIS

C

An ASP.NET HTTP handler is the process that runs in response to a request that is made to an ASP.NET Web application. ASP.NET maps HTTP requests to HTTP handlers based on a file name extension.
Incorrect:
Not B: HTTP modules differ from HTTP handlers. An HTTP handler returns a response to a request that is identified by a file name extension or family of file name extensions. In contrast, an HTTP module is invoked for all requests and responses. It subscribes to event notifications in the request pipeline and lets you run code in registered event handlers.

Which SessionState mode should you use? (Each correct answer presents a complete solution. Choose all that apply.)
A. StateServer
B. InProc
C. AutoDetect
D. SqlServer

AD
ASP.NET session state supports several different storage options for session data. Each option is identified by a value in the SessionStateMode enumeration. The following list describes the available session state modes:
StateServer mode, which stores session state in a separate process called the ASP.NET state service. This ensures that session state is preserved if the Web application is restarted and also makes session state available to multiple Web servers in a Web farm.
SQLServer mode stores session state in a SQL Server database. This ensures that session state is preserved if the Web application is restarted and also makes session state available to multiple Web servers in a Web farm.
InProc mode, which stores session state in memory on the Web server. This is the default.
Custom mode, which enables you to specify a custom storage provider. Off mode, which disables session state.

468)You are developing an application that uses ASP.NET Core Identity for authorization. The application must use an existing Microsoft Azure Table Storage 
instance to store user information. You create a custom UserStore class. You need to register the class as a dependency. Which two interfaces 
should you implement? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

A. IUserSecurityStampStore
B. IUserLoginStore
C. IQueryableUserStore
D. IUserStore
E. IUserPasswordStore

DE

There is nothing in the requirements about external identity providers. I am not sure but personally I would go for IUserStore and IUserPasswordStore.
Create a UserStore class that provides the methods for all data operations on the user. This class is equivalent to the UserStore class. In your UserStore class, implement IUserStore<TUser> and the optional interfaces required. You select which optional interfaces to implement based on the functionality provided in your app.
Interfaces to implement when customizing user store
✑ IuserStore
The IUserStore<TUser> interface is the only interface you must implement in the user store. It defines methods for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving users.
✑ IuserLoginStore
The IUserLoginStore<TUser, TKey> defines the methods you must implement in your user store to enable external authentication providers. It contains methods for adding, removing and retrieving user logins, and a method for retrieving a user based on the login information.

469) You manage an application that has a custom API. Your company purchases another company. Employees from the purchased company use their own Microsoft
Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). You need to reconfigure the application to ensure that all users can access the application by using the API. 
You have the following requirements:

✑ Implement authentication for Azure API management.
✑ Configure the API gateway for proper authorization.
✑ Integrate metrics into one dashboard.
✑ Apply additional restrictions to all roles.

What should you implement? To answer, configure the appropriate options in the dialog box in the answer area.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

Choices:

Provide authentication for API managment: {Azure virtual networks} | {Groups} | {Ipsec VPN} }
Configure the gateway: {Transforms} | { Groups } | { Policies }
Integrate metrics into one Dashboard: {Application Insights} | {Azure Monitor} | {Log Analytics} | {Stream Analytics}
Add restrictions for all users: {Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)} | {Azure Key Vault} | {Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)}

Answer: 

Provide authentication for API managment: Groups
Configure the gateway: Policies
Integrate metrics into one Dashboard: Application Insights
Add restrictions for all users: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), //allows for fine grained access controle on Azure resources.


Add an external Azure AD group -
After you enable access for users in an Azure AD instance, you can add Azure AD groups in API Management. Then, you can more easily manage the association of the developers in the group with the desired products.
To configure an external Azure AD group, you must first configure the Azure AD instance on the Identities tab by following the procedure in the previous section.
You add external Azure AD groups from the Groups tab of your API Management instance.

Box 2: Policies -
Policies are applied inside the gateway which sits between the API consumer and the managed API. The gateway receives all requests and usually forwards them unaltered to the underlying API. However a policy can apply changes to both the inbound request and outbound response.

Box 3: Application Insights -
Application Insights is an extensible Application Performance Management (APM) service for web developers on multiple platforms. Use it to monitor your live web application.
Box 4: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Apply additional restrictions to all roles.
Azure API Management relies on Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to enable fine-grained access management for API Management services and entities (for example, APIs and policies).

472) You are maintaining a load-balanced ASP.NET MVC web application. The load balancer uses the status endpoint to determine if the instance is healthy.
You monitor the application uptime by using multiple App Insight URL ping tests on the status endpoint. You track request latency for the application in Microsoft
Azure Application Insight.
Your DevOps team reports that the application is behaving in unexpected ways. The latency of most requests is the same. Application Insights often falls back to sampling, and the sampling period is very high.
You need to ensure that the application provides the correct information.

473) You are designing a distributed application that runs on the Microsoft Azure platform.
The application must store a small amount of insecure global information for all users that
does not change frequently. You need to configure the application to meet the requirements.
Which server-side state management option should you use? Each correct answer
presents a complete solution. Choose all that apply.

Option A	
profile properties of the Microsoft Azure application

Option B	
Microsoft Azure session state

Option C	
SQL Database

Option D	
Microsoft Azure application state

Correct Answer	A

According to the question, we need to store a small amount of insecure global information for all users that
does not change frequently. This means that the global information is not shared between users, it is specific
to a certain user, hence we need to store and persist it in the user profile.

In many applications, you want to store and use information that is unique to a user. 
When a user visits your site, you can use the information you have stored to present the user with a personalized version of 
your Web application. Personalizing an application requires a number of elements: 
you must store the information using a unique user identifier, be able to recognize users when they visit again, 
and then fetch the user information as needed. To simplify your applications, you can use the ASP.NET profile feature, 
which can perform all of these tasks for you.

478) You are using the features of the IIS SEO Toolkit to configure the website.
You need to exclude search engines from indexing parts of website.
What should you do? (To answer, select the appropriate option from the drop-down list in the answer area.)

Choices:
1) exclude
2) disallow
3) User-Agent.Exclusion
4) Robots Exclusion 
5) robots.txt
6) exclusion.txt

Use the {Target_1} feature in the IIS Search Optimization Toolkit to create a {Target_2} file and add {Target_3} rules. 

Answer:

Use the Robots Exclusion feature in the IIS Search Optimization Toolkit to create a robots.txt file and add disallow rules. 

The SEO Toolkit is not built in to IIS; you download the toolkit from Microsoft.com. With
the SEO Toolkit installed, you can analyze a website or a web application, create sitemaps, and
create robot exclusion rules and a robots.txt file for a site, which tell search engines not to
index a certain page.

479) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application that takes customer orders.
Orders are restricted to customers with IP addresses based in the United States.
You need to implement a custom route handler. You have the following code:

public class CustomRouteHandler:Target_1
{
	public Target_2 GetHttpHandler(Target_3 requestContext)
	{
		return new CustomMVCHandler(requestContext);
	}
} 
 
Choices:

2) IHttpConstraint
3) IRouteHandler 
4) IRouteFactory
5) IHttpHandler
6) ServerContext
 
Which code segments should you include in Target1, Target 2 and Target 3 to implement the route handler? To answer, drag the appropriate code segments to the correct targets. 
Each code segment may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.

Answer:

public class CustomRouteHandler:IRouteHandler
{
	public IHttpHandler GetHttpHandler(RequestContext requestContext)
	{
		return new CustomMVCHandler(requestContext);
	}
} 

This class implements IRouteHandler and has only one method "GetHttpHandler". The main purpose of this class is to return the instance of CustomHandler class. 
In the constructor, we are passing the RequestContext to the handler.

481) You are designing an application in which a section of the main page will be populated by content from a third-party provider. You do not have control 
over the responsive­ness of the client or how much information will be returned with each request. The call is to a RESTful service and will return the 
information formatted in Extensible Markup Language (XML). What is the best way to implement this application? 

A. Design a model that handles the data call to populate the model. Create a partial view containing only this display area and put an asynchronous service call that returns this model in the partial view controller. 
B. Put a synchronous service call into the main page controller.
C. Create a partial view containing only this display area and put a synchronous ser­vice call in the partial view controller.
D. Create a partial view containing only this display area and put an asynchronous service call in the partial view controller.

A

Explanation
A. Correct: Because you do not have control over the responsiveness of the third-party provider and you do not know how much data might be returned from each call, you should wrap the call in the asynchronous framework. Providing the data in a strongly-typed model gives it more flexibility than working with the raw XML on the client side.
B. Incorrect: You do not know how long the call to the third party will take, and put­ting a synchronous call into the main page will not give any response until the call is completed.
C. Incorrect: You do not want to use a synchronous call in this case due to the un­known response time.
D. Incorrect: Although you can take this approach, it infers that you will manipulate the third-party response data in either the controller or the view. SoC recommends that this manipulation occur in a model.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
482) You have been given requirements for a dashboard page that will contain summary information from your order processing system in a single display table. However, this summarization needs to be done by combining data requests from the order system, the shipping system, and the accounting system. The dashboard page will be the only place you use this combined data. What is the best way to implement this require­ment?

A. Make the various data requests and compile the information in the controller for display.
B. Create an individual model for each of the data requests, and then create a view-specific model that calls those models and merges the data.
C. Create a model for the summary data and handle the various data requests within that model as well as the merging of the data.
D. Create an individual model for each of the data requests and then merge the data on the client side for display.

B
Explanation
A. Incorrect: You should not perform any data manipulation in the controller.
B. Correct: You will have a better chance of code reuse if you break down the separate calls into their own models and then create another model to pull them together and compile them.
C. Incorrect: Although this would be a plausible way to implement the solution, it is not the best. If any other work came up that uses any of the calls within this model, you will either have to refactor the code to extract it at that point or have duplicate code.
D. Incorrect: The fact that this data can be merged into a single table display shows there is some intrinsic business worth to the information in this format. Merging on the client side goes against SoC considerations.

483)A significant change has been requested in an application maintained within your company. The application is a classic ASP application that uses custom Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) drivers to connect to a relational data repository on a mainframe computer. The CIO decided that the company needs to replace this 30-year-old sys­tem. The team that worked on the original project is made up of developers who have never worked with an object-oriented approach before.

Which approaches would be the best to use when designing your initial schema in Entity Framework? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Create your own custom design because it’s too much work to manage an inexpe­rienced staff.
B. Use Code First.
C. Use Model First. 
D. Use Database First. 
Answer:
CD
Explanation
A. Incorrect: You should incorporate your team into the project as soon as possible.
B. Incorrect: Because the team has no experience with object-oriented program­ming, the Code First approach is unlikely to be the most efficient way to create the new schema.
C. Correct: The use of the Entity Designer as an integral component in the Model First approach will help unfamiliar users to walk through the process.
D. Correct: There is already a working relational database for the application, although it is in a system that will be replaced. A port of the design should be considered.

484) You are designing an application that allows employees to change their human resources (HR) information, such as next of kin and direct deposit information. The re­quirements state that the application should talk directly to the HR systems’ database.

However, at a recent company meeting, the CFO announced that the company will be converting to a new HR system over the next two years. They will take an additional year to move employees to the new system, one department at a time. How will this affect your design?

A. It won’t; the requirements state that the application should talk directly to the HR systems’ database.
B. You should ensure your naming convention for the database as clearly as possible so you can rework your data calls with minimal changes.
C. You should implement the Repository pattern with the current HR system being the first repository that is built. When the second system comes online, you imple­ment that data access using the same pattern. 
D. You should map the model directly to the database calls, anticipating that you will have to change the model as the new system rolls out.
Answer:
C
Explanation
A. Incorrect: It is the designer’s job to ensure that any known enhancements or fu­ture changes are accounted for. Although this approach follows the requirements, it is not the best long-term solution.
B. Incorrect: This solution does not provide the proper level of abstraction; it re­quires either a “one or the other” approach to supporting the HR system, or an approach in which you have to manage which database you are calling from within each data call.
C. Correct: Using the Repository pattern will give you a level of abstraction into the data layer. When you create the second data access component for the new HR system, you can then differentiate on a user or departmental level which imple­mentation to use.
D. Incorrect: This solution does not provide the proper level of abstraction; it re­quires either a “one or the other approach” to supporting the HR system, or an approach in which you have to manage which database you are calling from within each data call.

485) You are developing an application. One requirement is that part of your data access layer needs to be available to a third party, that wants to get this information from a REST URL in XML.

Your company does not have experience with web services, but you have several websites running ASP.NET MVC 4. How could you design and provide these new services? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Task an individual on staff to learn WCF, and have this individual develop and deploy these new services using WCF.
B. Use the Web API to create REST services using ApiController in which the serialization type is defined by the Accepts property of the browser. 
C. Build a basic ASP.NET MVC 4 project in which the view simply passes through the information provided by the controller, and the controller manages the code for serializing the response. 
D. Create an ASP.NET ASMX services file to get, serialize, and return the data.
Answer:
BC
Explanation
A. Incorrect: Although you would eventually be able to get a WCF REST services, it would not be efficient.
B. Correct: Using the Web API is a straightforward way to present REST services.
C. Correct: Using ASP.NET MVC is another way to create a controller that will return XML.
D. Incorrect: An ASMX web service is SOAP-based, not REST-based.

486) Multiple Choices
How could you traditionally consume an ASMX web service from your application? (Choose all that apply.)

A. Generate a proxy by selecting Add Reference In Visual Studio.
B. Create an HttpService and connect using Get(URL). 
C. Generate a proxy by selecting Add A Service Reference in Visual Studio. 
D. Create a WCF proxy class.
Answer:
BC
Explanation
ASMX was the old way of pconsuming web services. This has now been replaced with WCF and Web API

A. Incorrect: Selecting Add Reference does not enable you to create a proxy.
B. Correct: HttpService.Get gets the output of a REST service.
C. Correct: Visual Studio creates a proxy for you from the WSDL at the site you select.
D. Incorrect: A WCF proxy class needs endpoints and bindings. REST services do not use, nor understand, WCF endpoints and bindings.

Application state is a data repository available to all classes in an ASP.NET application. Application state is stored in memory on the server and is faster than storing and retrieving information in a database. Unlike session state, which is specific to a single user session, application state applies to all users and all sessions. Therefore, application state is a useful place to store small amounts of often-used data that does not change from one user to another. The topics in this section provide information on how application state works and how to use it.
SQL Database provides a relational database management system for Windows Azure and is based on SQL Server technology. With a SQL Database instance, you can easily provision and deploy relational database solutions to the cloud, and take advantage of a distributed data center that provides enterprise-class availability, scalability, and security with the benefits of built-in data protection and self-healing.

490) You are designing a distributed banking application that handles multiple customers. A user may log on to the site to perform activities such as checking balances, performing transactions, and other activities that must be done securely.
The application must store secure information that is specific to an individual user. The data must be automatically and securely purged when the user logs off.
You need to save transient information in a secure data store.
Which data store should you use?

A. NET session state
B. NET profile properties
C. NET application state
D. Shared database

A

ASP.NET session state enables you to store and retrieve values for a user as the user navigates ASP.NET pages in a Web application. HTTP is a stateless protocol. This means that a Web server treats each HTTP request for a page as an independent request. The server retains no knowledge of variable values that were used during previous requests. ASP.NET session state identifies requests from the same browser during a limited time window as a session, and provides a way to persist variable values for the duration of that session.

491)You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application that uses forms authentication to verify that the user is logged in.
Authentication credentials must be encrypted and secure so no user identity is exposed.
You need to ensure that user credentials are persisted after users log on.
In which two locations can you store the credentials? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

A. In Session on the server
B. In a cookie stored in the browser
C. In ViewData in the application
D. In TempData on the server

AB

Server sessions and cookies can both be configured to secure and they both persist after the users log on.
Incorrect Answers:
C: ViewData's life only lasts during current http request.
D: TempData is a bucket where you can dump data that is only needed for the following request. That is, anything you put into TempData is discarded after the next request completes.

492) You are developing an ASP.NET MVC application that uses forms authentication. The application uses SQL queries that display customer order data.
Logs show there have been several malicious attacks against the servers.
You need to prevent all SQL injection attacks from malicious users against the application.
How should you secure the queries?
A. Check the input against patterns seen in the logs and other records.
B. Escape single quotes and apostrophes on all string-based input parameters.
C. Implement parameterization of all input strings.
D. Filter out prohibited words in the input submitted by the users.

Correct Answer: C
SQL Injection Prevention, Defense Option 1: Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries)
The use of prepared statements (aka parameterized queries) is how all developers should first be taught how to write database queries. They are simple to write, and easier to understand than dynamic queries. Parameterized queries forcethe developer to first define all the SQL code, and then pass in each parameter to the query later. This coding style allows the database to distinguish between code and data, regardless of what user input is supplied.
Prepared statements ensure that anattacker is not able to change the intent of a query, even if SQL commands are inserted by an attacker.
