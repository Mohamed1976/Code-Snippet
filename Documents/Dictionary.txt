SoC: separation of concern N-tier development is an example of SoC in which the user interface
	(UI) is separated from both the business layer and the data access layer.
	A term closely associated with SoC is loose coupling (limit the amount of interdependencies between various parts of a system).
MVC: Model-View-Controller 
ORM: object relational mapper (for example Entity Framework, NHibernate)
RDBMS relational database management system 
POCO: plain old CLR object
Loose coupling: is an architectural approach in which the designer seeks to limit the amount of interdependencies between various
	parts of a system. By reducing interdependencies, changes to one area of an application are
	less likely to affect another area. Also, by eliminating interdependencies, you ensure that your
	application is more maintainable, testable, and flexible, which tends to result in a more stable system.

ORM O/RM, or O/R Mapping object-relational mapping, LINQ-to-SQL was one of the first major Microsoft initiatives to build an ORM tool.		
EF 		Entity Framework: The primary benefit of using EF is that it enables developers to manipulate data as
		domain-specific objects without regard to the underlying structure of the data store.
		Ways to use EF is via a Code First technique, DataBase First technique and Model First technique. 
TPH		Table per Hierarchy It creates a single table for all objects in an inheritance hierarchy, and it simply
		has nullable columns for fields that aren’t common across all types. It also adds a Discriminator
		column so EF can keep track of the type of each individual record.
TPT		Table per Type. Creates a table for your base type that has all common fields in it, a table for each child type that stores the additional
		fields, as well as an ID to the base type’s record that stores the common fields. The multiple
		inheriting types’ tables are linked to one another via a foreign key that has a shared primary
		key value. In this case, to get all the data for a single entity, EF must perform a join across multiple tables.
