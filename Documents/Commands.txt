#Signing an assembly can be done both at the command line and by using Visual Studio.
#The first step you have to take is to generate a key pair. A key pair is usually a file with an .snk
#extension that contains your public/private key information.
#When using the developer command prompt, you can run the following command to
#generate a new key pair file:
#PATH=C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v10.0A\bin\NETFX 4.8 Tools
sn -k myKey.snk

#After signing an assembly, you can view the public key by using the Strong Name tool.
sn -Tp C:\MusicStorage.dll

#You can view the content of your GAC by running the following command from a developer command prompt:
gacutil -l

#Installing an assembly in the GAC can be done with the following command:
gacutil –i [assembly name]//for example, gacutil -i "C:\MusicStorage.dll"

#You can also remove an assembly from the GAC:
gacutil –u [assembly name] //for example without dll extension, gacutil -u MusicStorage
